Ever since I started running 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' style games, test prep has never been the same. Here's exactly how to do it.",

    {
      "question": "How do I run a 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' game in my classroom?",

Include lifelines: 50:50 (remove two wrong answers), Ask the Audience (class votes), and Phone a Friend (ask a classmate). Add dramatic pacing for engagement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What lifelines work best for classroom quiz games?",
      "answer": "Classic lifelines include 50:50 (remove half the wrong answers), Ask the Audience (class votes anonymously), Phone a Friend (choose one classmate to consult), and Switch Question (get a different question of similar difficulty). These encourage collaboration while maintaining game tension."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I write good multiple choice questions for classroom games?",
      "answer": "Create tiered difficulty: easy recall questions first, harder application questions later. Write plausible wrong answers (distractors) based on common misconceptions. Make questions 1-3 achievable for everyone to build confidence before difficulty increases."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I keep the whole class engaged during a quiz game?",
      "answer": "Require audience silence (with consequences). Use Ask the Audience lifeline to involve everyone. Keep games short (3-5 contestants per session). Rotate who plays over multiple days. Make anyone eligible for Phone a Friend so they must stay mentally engaged."
    },
    {
      "question": "What subjects work with game show format reviews?",
      "answer": "Any subject with factual content works well: history, science, math, language arts, foreign languages, even PE for rules and health content. The format is especially effective for end-of-unit review sessions before tests."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need technology to run classroom quiz games?",
      "answer": "No technology required—you can run games with verbal questions only. However, digital tools enhance the experience: random name pickers for fair selection, timers for urgency, sound effects for drama, and presentation slides for polished questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What prizes should I offer for classroom game winners?",
      "answer": "Effective prizes don't need to cost money: homework passes, seat choice privileges, extra recess time, small treats (check policy), or classroom 'currency' for larger rewards. Often, the excitement and recognition of winning is prize enough."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle wrong answers without embarrassing students?",
      "answer": "Thank the student for playing, briefly explain the correct answer, ask 'What made that tricky?' to validate the difficulty, and move on quickly. Frame wrong answers as learning opportunities. The game atmosphere should feel safe, not punishing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are variations of classroom Millionaire games?",
      "answer": "Team Millionaire: groups of 3-4 play together. Speed Millionaire: 5 questions, 20-second limits, no lifelines. Elimination Millionaire: whole class plays, wrong answers sit down, last standing wins. Each variation suits different time constraints and class sizes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to prepare a classroom quiz game?",
      "answer": "First game takes 30-60 minutes to prepare questions and understand format. Subsequent games take 15-20 minutes since you'll reuse the format and build a question bank. Once you have a bank of 50+ questions per subject, prep time drops to 5-10 minutes."
