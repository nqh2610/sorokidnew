    "intro": "Every evening at 5:47 PM, I'd feel my stomach clench. That's when my second-grader, Jake, would remember he had math homework. What followed was predictable: the worksheet would come out, Jake's face would crumple, and within three problems we'd both be in tears—him from frustration, me from exhaustion and guilt. After six months of this ritual torture, I finally figured out what was really going on. It wasn't about the math at all.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Should I push through the tears or stop?",
      "answer": "Neither extreme works well. Take a brief break (2-3 minutes), acknowledge the emotion, then return with something easier. Complete avoidance teaches that crying gets them out of hard things; pushing through distress teaches that their emotions don't matter. The middle path: acknowledge, reset, return."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will all this crying damage their relationship with math long-term?",
      "answer": "The tears themselves aren't the problem—how the situation is handled determines the long-term impact. If crying is met with frustration, shame, or punishment, yes, that can create lasting negative associations. If it's met with calm support and problem-solving, most kids recover and even thrive."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until we see improvement?",
      "answer": "With consistent changes to timing, format, and responses, most families see a noticeable reduction in tears within 2-4 weeks. Complete transformation usually takes 2-3 months. If nothing improves after 6 weeks of genuine changes, something else may be going on."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it okay to let them skip homework when they're upset?",
      "answer": "Occasionally, yes—forcing a child in full meltdown through homework teaches nothing positive. But it shouldn't become a pattern. Better approach: shorten the assignment, change the timing, or do it verbally instead of written. Find a way to do some math without the trigger."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child only cries about math, not other subjects. What does that mean?",
      "answer": "This is actually good news—it suggests the issue is specific to math context, not a broader emotional regulation problem. Something about math (or the math homework routine specifically) is triggering overwhelm. Identifying and changing that specific trigger is usually very effective."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I tell the teacher about the crying?",
      "answer": "Yes. Teachers can provide valuable insight about classroom behavior, modify assignments if appropriate, and ensure the child isn't being put on the spot in ways that increase anxiety. Most teachers want to help but can't if they don't know there's a problem."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child cries but can actually do the math when calm. What's happening?",
      "answer": "This is classic performance anxiety. The anxiety about doing math blocks access to knowledge they actually have. When calm (like in games or real-world contexts), that knowledge is accessible. The solution is reducing the anxiety around formal math, not drilling more math facts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does offering breaks reward the crying behavior?",
      "answer": "A brief, structured break isn't a reward—it's an emotional regulation tool. The key is returning to the task after the break. If breaks always lead to completely abandoning math, then yes, you're inadvertently reinforcing crying. But a 2-3 minute reset followed by resuming is teaching healthy coping, not escape."
