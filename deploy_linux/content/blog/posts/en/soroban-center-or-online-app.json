  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is online learning as effective as center learning?",
      "answer": "Depends on the child. Some kids do better online because they learn at their own pace without peer pressure. Some need in-person interaction. There's no 'better' method – just what fits your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which method should I try first?",
      "answer": "I'd suggest free app versions or YouTube first. Zero cost – if child is interested, then decide on further investment. Don't pay for a center before knowing if your child even likes it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine multiple methods?",
      "answer": "Yes, and many parents do. For example: daily app practice (consistent routine), weekend classes (friends, teacher check). Or app as main + occasional tutor when stuck."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if there's no Soroban center near me?",
      "answer": "Online learning or online tutor are great options. Modern Soroban doesn't require going to a center. Apps like Sorokid are designed for effective home self-study."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do different learning methods cost?",
      "answer": "Centers: $80-200/month. Tutors: $30-60/session (4-8 sessions/month = $120-480). Apps: $10-30/month or free basic. YouTube: free."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which method for young kids (4-5 years old)?",
      "answer": "App or YouTube with parent sitting together. Young children need adult companionship. Centers work too if small class sizes with experienced preschool teachers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which method for older kids (grades 3-4)?",
      "answer": "Older kids can self-study with apps better since they can read and have more discipline. Centers or tutors still good if you want guidance and level certifications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my child quit halfway with online learning?",
      "answer": "Possible without habits and supervision. Solutions: fixed study time, parent reminders, track streaks (consecutive study days), rewards for persistence."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child likes friends. Should I avoid apps?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Apps have leaderboards, competitions, and friend features. But if your child needs in-person social interaction to stay motivated, consider center + app combo."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I switch methods later?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Skills transfer between methods. Many families start with center for technique, then switch to app for convenience. Or vice versa. Nothing is locked in."
