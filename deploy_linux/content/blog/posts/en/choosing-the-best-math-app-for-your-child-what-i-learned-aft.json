  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can math apps replace tutoring completely?",
      "answer": "It depends on your needs. If your child just needs daily practice and reinforcement, apps can be enough. If they need to learn new concepts or have complex questions, they might need a tutor too. Many families combine both: apps for daily practice (cheap, convenient), tutoring periodically to address difficult topics."
    },
    {
      "question": "What age can kids start using math apps?",
      "answer": "Kids can start with simple apps (counting, shape recognition) around age 4-5. From age 6 (1st grade), they can use more structured math apps. However, limit screen time: 10-15 minutes/day for ages 4-6, 15-20 minutes/day for older kids."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are math apps bad for my child's eyes?",
      "answer": "If used too much, yes. Limit sessions to 15-20 minutes, maximum twice daily. Adjust screen brightness appropriately, have kids take eye breaks. If possible, use a tablet (larger screen) instead of a phone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I choose free or paid apps?",
      "answer": "Free apps often have ads or limited content. Paid apps usually have complete features, no ads, better support. My suggestion: try the free version first. If your child likes it and uses it consistently, invest in the paid version. A few dollars per month is much cheaper than tutoring."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child won't use the learning app, only wants to play other games. What do I do?",
      "answer": "Try an app with better gamification – so it feels like playing, not studying. Set a rule: 15 minutes of learning app before other games. Sit with your child and make it a shared activity. Praise and reward completion (stickers, points...)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if an app is good for my child?",
      "answer": "Try before you buy. Most apps have 3-7 day free trials. Observe: does your child enjoy it? Do they learn independently? Do they understand the lessons? After a week, if they're still enthusiastic and showing small improvements, that's a good app."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Sorokid different from other math apps?",
      "answer": "Sorokid focuses on the Soroban method (Japanese abacus) – it doesn't just teach getting answers right, it teaches calculating FAST. Kids learn to visualize an abacus in their head for super-fast mental math. Plus, Sorokid has a clear learning path, great gamification, and detailed parent reports."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does my child need a real abacus to use Sorokid?",
      "answer": "Not required. Sorokid has a virtual abacus for practice on screen. However, if you want a fuller experience, you can buy a real Soroban abacus (around $10-15) to use alongside. For beginners, the app's virtual abacus is sufficient."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can parents who don't know Soroban help their kids use Sorokid?",
      "answer": "Yes! Sorokid is designed for independent learning – with step-by-step guides and hints when kids make mistakes. Parents don't need to know Soroban; just sit nearby and encourage. The app has progress reports so parents can track without understanding the technical details."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see progress with Sorokid?",
      "answer": "After 2-4 weeks of consistent use (15 minutes/day), kids start calculating FASTER – noticeable reduction in time per problem. After 2-3 months, kids become more confident and stop counting on fingers. The Sorokid method builds a strong foundation that keeps improving over time."
