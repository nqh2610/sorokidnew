  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "If I don't know Soroban, how do I know my child is learning correctly?",
      "answer": "The app has an automatic checking system. If your child makes a mistake, it's corrected immediately. Parents can view progress reports to see how far they've learned, their accuracy percentage, and which areas are challenging."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child asks something I can't answer?",
      "answer": "Let your child 'teach' you. This has two benefits: they review the knowledge, and they feel 'smarter than mom/dad' at something – great for building confidence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I learn Soroban myself to help my child?",
      "answer": "If you have time and interest, great. But it's not required. Your child can absolutely learn with the app without parents knowing Soroban at all."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see my child improving?",
      "answer": "Usually after 2-4 weeks of consistent practice. Signs of progress: faster calculation, more confident with numbers, and genuine interest in learning. Don't expect instant results."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many minutes should my child practice daily?",
      "answer": "15-20 minutes daily is ideal. What's important is CONSISTENCY, not practicing a lot at once. 15 minutes x 7 days is more effective than 1 hour x 2 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Mom or Dad better at helping?",
      "answer": "Both work great. What matters is someone who CARES and is CONSISTENT. If both parents participate, the child will sense that learning is important to the whole family."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is lazy about practicing. What should I do?",
      "answer": "Build a fixed schedule. Give breaks between sessions. Praise effort. Don't scold – it creates negative associations with learning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Sorokid suitable for kids who are new to Soroban?",
      "answer": "Yes. Sorokid has lessons starting from the very basics – getting familiar with the abacus, recognizing numbers 1-9, then moving to addition and subtraction. No prior knowledge needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "If parents are too busy to sit with their child, what then?",
      "answer": "No need to sit beside them. Just: remind them to practice at the scheduled time, praise them after they finish, and review reports on weekends. The child self-learns with the app; parents monitor remotely."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child gets frustrated with difficult problems. What should parents do?",
      "answer": "Don't do it for them. Say: 'Try watching the tutorial video again.' If it's still hard, take a break and come back later. Learning is a process – no need to rush."
