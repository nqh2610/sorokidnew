    "intro": "First day of school. New class. Thirty faces staring at you, silent as stones. No one talks to the person next to them. The air feels heavy with awkwardness. Sound familiar? This 'frozen' classroom state is something every teacher encounters—not just at the beginning of the year, but after holidays, before difficult content, or whenever energy drops. Ice breakers are your solution. But not all ice breakers are created equal. After nine years of testing activities with thousands of students, I've identified 15 that consistently work—activities that warm up cold classrooms, build genuine connections, and set the stage for engaged learning. Here's my complete playbook.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long should ice breaker activities last?",
      "answer": "Most ice breakers should be 5-10 minutes maximum. They're warm-ups, not the main lesson. If an activity takes longer than 10 minutes, it's likely too complex for an ice breaker purpose. Quick, energizing, and transitional is the goal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if students refuse to participate in ice breakers?",
      "answer": "Start with low-risk, low-exposure activities. Allow observation initially but gently encourage participation over time. Some students need to see activities are safe before joining. Never force participation in ways that create embarrassment—that defeats the purpose."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ice breakers just for the beginning of the year?",
      "answer": "No! Ice breakers are valuable throughout the year: after holidays when students need to reconnect, before difficult content to reduce anxiety, when energy is low (especially after lunch), when new students join, or before group work to build collaboration readiness."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I choose the right ice breaker for my class?",
      "answer": "Consider: What's the current energy level? What do students need (connection, energy, calm)? How well do they know each other? How much time do you have? What follows the ice breaker? Match the activity to the moment and purpose."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can ice breakers be educational too?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Activities like Number Talk Warm-Up, Freeze Dance Math, and Quick-Fire Categories with academic content combine social/emotional benefits with academic activation. However, not every ice breaker needs to be academic—building community has its own value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if an ice breaker falls flat?",
      "answer": "It happens to everyone. Have a graceful exit: 'Let's try something different!' and move to a backup activity. Afterward, reflect on why it didn't work—wrong energy level? Unclear instructions? Not appropriate for the group? Learn and adjust."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I manage transitions into and out of ice breakers?",
      "answer": "Use clear signals: a specific sound, countdown, or phrase that students recognize. Practice transitions explicitly early in the year. Good ice breakers have natural endpoints; avoid activities that are hard to stop."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ice breakers appropriate for all grade levels?",
      "answer": "Yes, with appropriate modifications. Younger students generally enjoy more movement and silliness. Older students may prefer activities that feel more mature but still build connection. The core principles (low risk, high participation, genuine connection) apply across ages."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I make ice breakers inclusive for all students?",
      "answer": "Offer multiple ways to participate (verbal, non-verbal, movement, seated). Avoid activities that require specific physical abilities unless alternatives exist. Be culturally aware—some activities may not translate across cultures. Always have options."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I use ice breakers?",
      "answer": "There's no fixed rule, but many teachers find value in brief daily connection activities (2-3 minutes) plus longer ice breakers (5-10 minutes) weekly or when needed. Don't overuse any single activity—variety keeps them fresh and engaging."
