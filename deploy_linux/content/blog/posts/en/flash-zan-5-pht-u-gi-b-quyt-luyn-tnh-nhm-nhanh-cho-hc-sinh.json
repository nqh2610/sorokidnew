    "intro": "Every morning, my class has a special ritual: 5 minutes of Flash Anzan. I originally started it just to wake students up and fill the awkward minutes before first period. But three months later, something unexpected happened—my students' mental math improved dramatically, and they actually started looking FORWARD to this activity. Here's how a simple brain warmup transformed from 'filler time' into the most anticipated part of the day.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How long should Flash Anzan sessions be?",
      "answer": "5 minutes daily is optimal. Shorter sessions don't build habit; longer sessions become tedious and lose the 'game' feel. Consistency matters more than duration—daily brief practice beats occasional long sessions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What age can children start Flash Anzan?",
      "answer": "Children as young as 5-6 can start with very simple levels (2-3 small numbers, slow speed). The method scales from kindergarten through adult—just adjust difficulty. The key is starting easy enough that everyone experiences success."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see mental math improvement?",
      "answer": "Most teachers report noticeable improvement within 4-8 weeks of daily practice. Speed increases first, then accuracy. Students often show improved focus and working memory on non-math tasks too."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if some students are much faster than others?",
      "answer": "Use personal improvement tracking rather than rankings. Faster students can try 'boss levels' while others work at their pace. Group activities can pair stronger and weaker students as teams. Avoid public comparison."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need special equipment for Flash Anzan?",
      "answer": "Just a screen (projector, TV, or tablet) and a Flash Anzan source (app, YouTube, or web tool). Sorokid includes built-in Flash Anzan. Free YouTube videos also work. No physical materials needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Flash Anzan feel like a game rather than drill?",
      "answer": "The elements of games are present: clear goals, immediate feedback, incremental difficulty, and achievable challenge. Numbers appearing and disappearing creates urgency without stress. The 'flow state' makes practice feel effortless."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Flash Anzan help with test anxiety?",
      "answer": "Yes, indirectly. Students who develop automatic calculation skills spend less mental energy on basic math during tests. Less cognitive load means less anxiety. The practice of performing under time pressure also builds comfort with timed assessments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I grade Flash Anzan performance?",
      "answer": "No. Grading kills the game-like motivation. Keep it low-stakes and fun. Use it to build skills, not assess them. If you must evaluate, use occasional individual spot-checks separate from the daily routine."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Flash Anzan relate to soroban/abacus learning?",
      "answer": "Flash Anzan originated from soroban training—students visualize moving beads mentally. Even without soroban background, Flash Anzan builds similar mental calculation skills. Soroban students often excel at Flash Anzan because they have a visual framework for mental math."
