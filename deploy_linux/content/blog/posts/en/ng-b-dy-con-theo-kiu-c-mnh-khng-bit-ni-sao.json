    "intro": "\"What's 7 times 8?\" my father-in-law asked my son Jason. Jason started drawing groups on his paper. \"Just memorize it! 56! Why are you drawing?\" Grandpa said, frustrated. \"That's not how we do it, Grandpa,\" Jason replied. \"Mrs. Miller says we need to understand it.\" Grandpa looked at me with confusion and a hint of hurt. \"What's wrong with memorizing? That's how I learned. That's how your husband learned. It worked fine.\" In that moment, I faced a dilemma many parents know: How do I honor my in-laws' desire to help, respect their generation's educational approach, protect my child's school learning, and maintain family harmony? This wasn't just about multiplication tables—it was about love, respect, generational identity, and the evolution of education. Here's how our family navigated this challenge and found an approach that works for everyone.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why do grandparents teach math differently than modern schools?",
      "answer": "Grandparents learned in an era that emphasized memorization, speed, and standardized procedures. Modern education focuses on conceptual understanding before fluency. Neither is wrong—they reflect different educational research and goals from different eras."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I stop grandparents from helping with math homework?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Instead, help grandparents understand current methods and define roles where their approach adds value, like fact fluency practice after concepts are understood. The relationship benefits are too valuable to sacrifice if coordination is possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I tell grandparents their method confuses my child?",
      "answer": "Frame it as coordination, not criticism: \"The teacher wants Jason to use a specific method so she knows he understood the lesson. Can we save other approaches for after homework?\" Emphasize the school requirement rather than grandparent error."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is memorization actually bad for learning math?",
      "answer": "No—memorization has value for building fluency with facts. The issue is sequence: understanding should come first, then fluency through practice. Grandparents' drill approach is valuable after children understand concepts, not before."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if grandparents refuse to change their approach?",
      "answer": "Set gentle boundaries: reserve homework for parent supervision and give grandparents other math activities like games or puzzles. Focus on preserving the relationship while protecting your child's learning consistency."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle it when my child says 'Grandpa says that's wrong'?",
      "answer": "Explain that there are multiple ways to solve math problems, all valid. \"Grandpa's way and your school way both work. For homework, we use the school way. Grandpa's way is another tool you might use later.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I show grandparents how to use modern math methods?",
      "answer": "If they're interested, yes! Many grandparents are genuinely curious when methods are explained without judgment. Showing why schools teach differently often transforms resistance into understanding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if grandparents are the primary homework helpers due to childcare?",
      "answer": "Provide them with method explanations for each topic, create a homework folder with instructions, include them in teacher communications, and have regular check-ins about what's being taught at school."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do cultural expectations affect this situation?",
      "answer": "In cultures that emphasize elder respect, direct correction can damage relationships. Frame differences as school requirements, lead with gratitude, involve grandparents in solutions, and have the appropriate family member lead sensitive discussions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Soroban help bridge generational teaching differences?",
      "answer": "Yes! Soroban is often new to both grandparents and children, creating shared learning without competing methods. Learning together shifts the dynamic from \"teaching/correcting\" to \"exploring together.\""
