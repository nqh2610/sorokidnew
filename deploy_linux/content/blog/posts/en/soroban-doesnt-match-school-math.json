    {
      "question": "Should I tell the teacher my child does Soroban?",
      "answer": "You can, but it's not required. Teachers generally don't mind as long as homework is done correctly. Some teachers are even interested and supportive!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child insists on using only Soroban at school?",
      "answer": "Gently explain that school tests often require showing work. For homework and tests, use the school method. For real life and Soroban practice at home, use Soroban. Both have their place."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will Soroban hurt my child's school math grades?",
      "answer": "Usually the opposite! Soroban improves number sense, which helps with all math. Any initial confusion is temporary; the long-term benefits are significant."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the adjustment period last?",
      "answer": "Typically 2-4 weeks. During this time, remind your child which method to use where. After that, they usually switch contexts automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the teacher says Soroban is 'wrong'?",
      "answer": "Explain to your child that it's not about right or wrong – it's about what each situation requires. At school, follow the teacher's instructions. The skill your child learns from Soroban still helps them calculate faster and check their work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can my child write the answer first and work backwards?",
      "answer": "This depends on the teacher, but generally yes. Many kids mentally calculate the answer, then write out the steps they 'would have done.' As long as the work is correct, most teachers accept this."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will learning two methods make my child slower?",
      "answer": "No – it usually makes them faster. They can quickly get the answer mentally, then spend time writing it out. They finish tests faster than students who calculate while writing."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child argues with the teacher about methods. What should I do?",
      "answer": "Teach social skills alongside math skills. Explain that being good at mental math is great, but respecting the teacher and following classroom rules is also important. Quietly getting right answers is better than arguing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does this apply to all school subjects or just math?",
      "answer": "Mainly math, but the principle of 'knowing multiple approaches' helps everywhere. The flexibility your child develops transfers to other problem-solving situations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child starts preferring written math over Soroban?",
      "answer": "That's okay! The goal is for your child to have options. If they naturally prefer one method for certain situations, that's fine. The important thing is they have both tools available."
