The quiet ones never spoke. The eager hand-raisers dominated every discussion. Then I found a simple solution: let a random spinner decide who speaks next. The complaints stopped immediately.",

    {
      "question": "What is a random student picker wheel?",
      "answer": "A random student picker wheel is a digital or physical spinning tool that randomly selects student names. Teachers input their class roster, spin the wheel, and it randomly lands on a student name—removing bias and ensuring fair participation opportunities for everyone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do teachers use random name generators in class?",
      "answer": "Random name generators solve multiple problems: they eliminate favoritism complaints, ensure shy students participate, keep all students engaged (since anyone might be called), save teachers from tracking who they've called, and add an element of excitement to classroom discussions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does random calling help shy students participate?",
      "answer": "Shy students often understand material but avoid volunteering due to social anxiety. Random selection removes the social risk of hand-raising—'the wheel picked me' isn't a personal choice to be judged. This gives introverts a voice they wouldn't claim themselves."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best free random student picker tools?",
      "answer": "Popular free options include Wheel of Names, Picker Wheel, Random Name Picker, Flippity, and Sorokid's classroom tools. Most work on any browser without downloads. Features vary: some save class lists, some remove names after selection, some allow weighting."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle students who don't know the answer when randomly called?",
      "answer": "Build in support systems: allow 'lifelines' (spinning again for a helper), accept partial answers, ask follow-up questions that scaffold toward the answer, or give the option to 'pass and come back.' Never humiliate—the goal is participation, not punishment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does random calling work for all grade levels?",
      "answer": "Yes, with adjustments. Elementary students love the game-like spinning. Middle schoolers respond to the fairness logic. High schoolers appreciate that no one can hide. Adapt your wait-time, lifeline options, and question difficulty by age."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I set up a random name wheel for my class?",
      "answer": "Most online tools are simple: visit the website, paste or type your student names, and spin. Save your wheel (create an account if needed) so you don't re-enter names. Project on screen during class. Update when students join or leave."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between random picking and cold calling?",
      "answer": "Cold calling means calling on students without warning, often to check if they're paying attention. Random picking adds a visible, fair selection process. The transparency matters: students see randomness, not teacher targeting, which reduces anxiety and resentment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I exclude certain students from the wheel?",
      "answer": "Yes, most digital wheels allow removing names temporarily. Use this for students with accommodations, those absent that day, or after someone has already answered (ensuring everyone goes before anyone repeats). Some tools have this feature built in."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much class time does using a random picker take?",
      "answer": "Spinning takes 5-10 seconds. The dramatic effect actually focuses attention rather than wasting time. Over a class period, you might use 1-2 minutes total on spins—far less time than managing raised hands and complaints about unfair calling."
