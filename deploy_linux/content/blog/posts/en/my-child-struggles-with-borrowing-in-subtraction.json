    "intro": "\"What's 52 minus 28?\" – \"36!\" My daughter answered without hesitation. I looked again: 52 - 28 = 24, not 36. She was off by 12! This kept happening for six months straight. She could do addition with carrying perfectly, but subtraction with borrowing? 70% wrong. I thought she was bad at math. But after researching, I realized: she's not bad at math, she just wasn't taught the right way.",

    {
      "question": "What grade do kids learn subtraction with borrowing?",
      "answer": "Usually 2nd grade, first semester. But many kids still struggle into 3rd-4th grade if not taught correctly from the start."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Soroban help with subtraction with borrowing?",
      "answer": "Yes. Soroban helps kids 'see' borrowing visually through the beads. They understand the concept instead of just following a procedure."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child subtracts in reverse (8-2 instead of borrowing). What do I do?",
      "answer": "Use real objects so they understand: not enough means borrow. Ask: 'You have 2 candies, Mom wants 8. What do you do?' They'll realize they need to borrow more."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I help my child remember to 'pay back' after borrowing?",
      "answer": "Teach them to mark a dot above the number they borrowed from. When calculating that column, see dot = subtract 1 more. Saying 'Borrow 1' out loud also helps the brain remember."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until my child stops making borrowing errors?",
      "answer": "Usually 2-4 weeks with consistent daily practice of 10-15 minutes. The key is understanding the concept, not just memorizing the procedure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my child borrow when they don't need to?",
      "answer": "They're applying the rule without understanding. Go back to the basic question: 'Is the top number big enough to subtract the bottom number?' If yes, no borrowing needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Borrowing across zeros is a nightmare. Any tips?",
      "answer": "Practice 'chaining' – when borrowing from a zero, you need to borrow from the next place first. Use manipulatives: 400 = 3 hundreds + 10 tens = 3 hundreds + 9 tens + 10 ones."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I teach an alternative method if standard doesn't work?",
      "answer": "Yes. The number line method (count up from smaller to larger) is excellent. Some kids find it more intuitive than the standard algorithm."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many practice problems per day is enough?",
      "answer": "10 problems per day is enough for elementary kids. Quality and consistency matter more than quantity. Daily practice beats weekend cramming."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child gets frustrated with subtraction. How do I keep them motivated?",
      "answer": "Break into smaller chunks, celebrate small wins, use visual tools. An app with immediate feedback and rewards can help – kids see progress and stay motivated."
