    "intro": "'Any thoughts?' I asked. Silence. Twenty-five students stared at their desks. Not a single hand raised. It happened every time I asked an open question—the same few students would eventually speak, while most stayed silent. Then I learned Think-Pair-Share, and everything changed. This deceptively simple technique—three steps, five minutes—transformed my classroom from uncomfortable silence to genuine engagement. Students who had never volunteered an answer were suddenly sharing ideas. Quiet students became confident participants. Here's exactly how I made it work and how you can too.",

    {
      "question": "How long should each phase of Think-Pair-Share take?",
      "answer": "Typically: Think (1-2 minutes), Pair (2-3 minutes), Share (variable based on how many pairs share). Total time is usually 5-10 minutes. Adjust based on question complexity—deeper questions need more think and pair time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if students don't have anything to say to their partner?",
      "answer": "This often means the question wasn't clear or engaging enough, or think time was too short. Provide sentence starters: 'I think... because...' or 'I'm not sure, but maybe...' Circulate and prompt stuck pairs with guiding questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle a student who doesn't want to talk?",
      "answer": "Offer alternatives: they can share by showing written notes, nodding agreement/disagreement, or pointing to a visual. Build gradually—TPS is actually helpful for shy students because they only talk to one person first. Pair strategically with patient, supportive partners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I always call on pairs to share with the whole class?",
      "answer": "No—the 'Share' step doesn't require every pair to report. Sometimes the value is in the pair discussion itself. You might share some days and skip whole-class sharing other days, or just ask for a few highlights."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I prevent the same students from always sharing?",
      "answer": "Use random selection (sticks, cards, random name generator). Pre-select pairs while circulating ('I'd like to hear from you when we share'). Call on quiet students to share what their partner said (lower stakes). Track who shares over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best way to assign partners?",
      "answer": "Pre-assign partners based on your knowledge of students (ability, personality, seating). Change partners periodically (weekly, monthly, or per unit). Have a visible system so students know their partner immediately. Avoid 'find a partner' which creates exclusion anxiety."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Think-Pair-Share work with young children (K-2)?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Use simpler language: 'Think... Turn and talk... Let's hear from some friends.' Shorter times (30 seconds think, 1-2 minutes pair). More visual cues. Practice the routine explicitly. Young children love talking to partners once they know how."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is Think-Pair-Share different from just having students discuss in pairs?",
      "answer": "The key difference is the 'Think' step—explicit individual processing time before discussion. This ensures students have something to say and prevents the quickest thinker from dominating. The structure makes discussion more productive."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I use Think-Pair-Share?",
      "answer": "Daily! Multiple times per day is ideal. TPS can be used for any question worth thinking about. The more routine it becomes, the smoother it runs. Teachers who use it consistently report much higher engagement than those who use it occasionally."
    },
    {
      "question": "What questions work best for Think-Pair-Share?",
      "answer": "Open-ended questions with multiple valid responses: prediction questions, 'why' questions, strategy questions, connection questions. Avoid yes/no questions or simple recall questions—they don't generate much discussion. If the question has one obvious answer, TPS isn't necessary."
