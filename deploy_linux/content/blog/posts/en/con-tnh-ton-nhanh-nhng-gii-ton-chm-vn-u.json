    "intro": "My son trained Soroban for two years. He could mentally calculate 47 + 38 faster than I could type it into a calculator. I was proud—until his first word problem test came back with disappointing marks. The problem: 'An has 47 marbles. Binh gives him 38 more. How many marbles does An have now?' He hadn't solved it. 'But you know 47 + 38!' I said. He looked confused: 'But how was I supposed to know I should add?' That day I learned that calculation speed and problem comprehension are completely different skills—and excelling at one doesn't automatically mean mastery of the other.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why can my child calculate quickly but struggle with word problems?",
      "answer": "Calculation and problem comprehension are different skills. Calculation training (drills, Soroban, flashcards) gives the operation to execute. Word problems require identifying which operation to use—a separate skill that needs separate practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between computational fluency and problem comprehension?",
      "answer": "Computational fluency is executing operations accurately and quickly—knowing how to add, subtract, multiply, divide. Problem comprehension is understanding what a problem asks, identifying relevant information, and recognizing which operation to apply. Both are needed for complete math skill."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we stop Soroban training if word problems are weak?",
      "answer": "No! Calculation speed is valuable. Add comprehension practice alongside Soroban, don't replace it. Your child's calculation strength becomes more powerful when paired with understanding of when to use it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I teach my child to understand word problems?",
      "answer": "Use a structured approach: read the whole problem first, retell it in own words, identify what's being asked, determine the operation, then calculate. Visual drawing helps many children. Practice varied problem types, not just 'result unknown' problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are keyword strategies helpful for word problems?",
      "answer": "Keywords can be useful clues ('altogether' often means add, 'remaining' often means subtract), but they're not reliable rules. Some problems use misleading keywords. Teach keywords as clues while emphasizing that understanding the situation matters most."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my fast calculator rush through word problems?",
      "answer": "Speed-trained children learn that quick answers are valued. Word problems require the opposite: slowing down, reading carefully, thinking before computing. They may feel 'wrong' when they can't immediately calculate, causing them to grab numbers and guess operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the different word problem structures I should practice?",
      "answer": "Three main structures: result unknown (47 + 38 = ?), change unknown (47 + ? = 85), and start unknown (? + 38 = 85). Children who only see result-unknown problems don't develop flexible understanding. Vary the structures to build genuine comprehension."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to improve word problem skills?",
      "answer": "With consistent practice (15-20 minutes daily focused on comprehension, not just calculation), most children show significant improvement within 2-3 months. The key is practicing the understanding process, not just solving more problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does reading ability affect word problem performance?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Word problems are reading comprehension tasks first, math tasks second. Children with strong calculation but weak reading will struggle with word problems. Investing in reading skills improves math performance on word-based assessments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my child has a comprehension gap vs. calculation gap?",
      "answer": "Give your child the same problem two ways: as pure calculation (47 + 38 = ?) and as a word problem. If calculation is strong but word problem version fails, the gap is comprehension, not calculation. Focus practice accordingly."
