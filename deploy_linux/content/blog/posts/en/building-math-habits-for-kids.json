    "intro": "'Did you do your math today?' I asked my daughter for the fourth time. 'I'll do it later,' she said, not looking up from her book. Later never came. Or when it did, it was bedtime, she was tired, and we both ended up frustrated. This scene replayed daily in our house for two years. I'd remind, she'd forget or delay, I'd remind again, she'd resist, I'd lose patience. It was exhausting. I'm a productivity coach. I help adults build habits for a living. And I couldn't get my own kids to practice math consistently. The irony kept me up at night. But eventually, professional frustration pushed me to apply what I knew about adult habit formation to my children. What happened surprised me: within two months, all three of my kids were practicing math daily without a single reminder. Not because they suddenly loved math. Because it stopped requiring a decision.",

      "question": "What's the best time of day for math practice?",
      "answer": "There's no universal best time—it depends on your family's schedule. The key is choosing an anchor point that happens every single day without exception. Morning after breakfast works for many families because routines are more consistent before the day's chaos begins."

      "answer": "Yes, but frame it as sequence, not transaction. Not 'If you practice, you get screen time' but 'In our house, we do math, then screen time.' The brain needs positive consequences to cement habits, but bribes create resistance and transactional relationships."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we miss a day of practice?",
      "answer": "One miss doesn't break a habit—two misses start a new pattern. The critical rule: never miss twice in a row. If you miss Monday, Tuesday is non-negotiable. This protects the habit from small disruptions becoming permanent breaks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I maintain the habit during vacation?",
      "answer": "Decide in advance: either maintain practice (even minimally) or accept a complete break. No half-measures. If breaking, restart immediately when home—day one, not 'we'll start tomorrow.' Delays after vacation are where habits go to die."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my spouse isn't consistent with the routine?",
      "answer": "Parental inconsistency undermines habit formation. Have a direct conversation and align on non-negotiables. The same trigger-routine-reward must happen regardless of which parent is home. Consider designating one parent as the 'habit keeper' if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How short can practice sessions be while still being effective?",
      "answer": "Even 5 minutes of consistent daily practice builds skills and habits. Consistency matters more than duration—daily 5-minute sessions beat sporadic 30-minute sessions. Start smaller than you think necessary; you can always add time once the habit is established."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child still resists after weeks of trying. What's wrong?",
      "answer": "If resistance persists past 3-4 weeks, the routine is probably too long, too difficult, or has too much friction. Reduce duration until compliance comes easily. Success at 3 minutes builds to 10 minutes; struggle at 10 minutes builds resentment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should weekends be different from weekdays?",
      "answer": "Same routine 7 days per week builds habits fastest. But if weekends are genuinely different (travel, activities), 5 consistent weekdays can work—just make those 5 days absolutely rock solid. Weekend breaks slow formation but don't prevent it entirely."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know when the habit is truly formed?",
      "answer": "The habit is formed when: your child goes to practice without reminders, missing practice feels 'wrong' to them (not just you), there's no negotiation or resistance, and practice is just 'what we do'—an identity, not an obligation. This usually takes 2-3 months."
