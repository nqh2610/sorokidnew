Looking closely, I saw the pattern: '45' became '54,' 'subtract' was read as 'add,' the word 'each' was completely missed. She wasn't making calculation errors. She was misreading questions. I initially dismissed this as 'carelessness,' but after months of the same pattern, I realized this was a specific, diagnosable issue with specific solutions.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why does my child keep misreading math problems when they're careful with calculations?",
      "answer": "Misreading is a separate skill from calculating. Children can have strong computational abilities but struggle with reading accuracy due to visual processing speed, working memory overload, attention regulation, or test anxiety. The good news: reading accuracy can be specifically trained."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why doesn't 'be more careful' fix the problem?",
      "answer": "'Be careful' is vague—children don't know what specifically to do differently. They need concrete strategies: finger tracking, verbalization, highlighting, structured reading routines. Telling them to slow down without giving specific techniques just adds anxiety."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes number reversals like reading 45 as 54?",
      "answer": "Number reversals often occur when visual processing speed exceeds cognitive processing speed—eyes move faster than the brain can accurately encode information. Developmental factors play a role; reversals are common in young children but should decrease with age. Finger tracking and verbalization help."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does anxiety increase reading errors?",
      "answer": "Anxiety narrows attention and speeds processing as the brain tries to escape the threatening situation (the test). Faster processing means less accurate reading. Managing test anxiety through preparation, breathing techniques, and positive self-talk can reduce reading errors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the finger tracking technique?",
      "answer": "Use a finger or pencil tip to physically track under each word and number while reading. This slows visual processing to match cognitive processing, prevents eye-skipping, and ensures all parts of the problem are read. It's a professional technique used even by air traffic controllers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can verbalizing numbers prevent reversal errors?",
      "answer": "When children say numbers aloud ('forty-five' while looking at 45), they create a cross-check between visual and auditory processing. If they see 45 but accidentally say 'fifty-four,' the mismatch alerts them to the error before it affects their calculation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I let my child use highlighters on math tests?",
      "answer": "If allowed, yes! Highlighting the question, numbers, and operation words forces careful reading and creates a visual problem map. Check test policies—many allow highlighters. For tests that don't, practice the highlighting method in homework so the mental habit transfers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to fix misreading problems?",
      "answer": "With consistent strategy practice, most children show improvement within 4-8 weeks. Full habituation takes longer—typically 2-3 months before strategies become automatic. Consistency matters more than intensity; daily brief practice beats occasional long sessions."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I seek professional help for misreading issues?",
      "answer": "Consider evaluation if: number reversals persist past age 8-9, reading errors occur across all subjects, strategies don't help after 2-3 months, or you suspect dyslexia, dyscalculia, or ADHD. Learning specialists can identify specific processing differences and provide targeted interventions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is misreading problems a sign of a learning disability?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Occasional misreading is normal, especially under time pressure. Persistent, frequent misreading that doesn't improve with strategies may warrant evaluation for dyslexia, dyscalculia, or attention disorders. Most children, however, improve significantly with targeted strategy practice."
