    "intro": "I have three children: Emma (now 11), Noah (now 8), and Lily (now 6). Through a combination of curiosity and circumstance, I started each of them on soroban at very different ages—Emma at 9, Noah at 6, and Lily at 4. After watching all three navigate this journey, I've gained a unique perspective on the 'best age' question that every parent asks. The answer surprised me, and I think it'll help you make a much more informed decision for your own child.",

      "question": "Can older children still develop mental calculation (anzan)?",
      "answer": "Yes, but with lower ceilings. Children starting after age 9 can improve mental math significantly, but reaching elite visualization levels (seeing and manipulating beads mentally) is harder."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I wait until my child is 'old enough'?",
      "answer": "If your child is 5+ and shows readiness signs, don't wait unnecessarily. The visualization advantage of younger starting ages is real. That said, an unready 5-year-old should wait until ready—readiness trumps age."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should practice sessions be for different ages?",
      "answer": "Age 4-5: 5-10 minutes maximum. Age 6-8: 15-20 minutes. Age 9+: 20-30 minutes if engaged. Always stop before frustration sets in—short positive sessions beat long forced ones."
    },
    {
      "question": "My children are different ages. Should they all start together?",
      "answer": "They can start together but progress separately. Each child should work at their own level. The older child may progress faster initially; the younger may develop stronger visualization over time. Both paths are valid."
