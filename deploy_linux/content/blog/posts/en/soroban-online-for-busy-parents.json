  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "My child knows nothing about Soroban. Can they still learn online?",
      "answer": "Yes! The app teaches from the very beginning – starting with how to recognize numbers on the abacus. No prior knowledge needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is online learning as effective as in-person classes?",
      "answer": "It depends on your child. Some kids actually learn better online because they can go at their own pace. Others prefer having a real teacher. Try it to see which fits your child."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many minutes per day is enough?",
      "answer": "15-20 minutes is ideal for elementary school kids. Short but consistent beats long but irregular every time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get my child to practice independently?",
      "answer": "Sit with them the first week to build the habit. Practice at the same time every day. After 2-3 weeks, the routine forms and they become more self-motivated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is 15 minutes really enough to make progress?",
      "answer": "Yes! Research shows short daily practice beats longer occasional sessions. 15 focused minutes daily adds up to 7.5 hours monthly – that's real learning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I can't be present during practice?",
      "answer": "The app works independently. Many parents have their kids practice while cooking or doing chores nearby. You don't need to actively supervise every minute."
    },
    {
      "question": "Don't kids need in-person instruction for Soroban?",
      "answer": "For fundamentals, apps teach very effectively. In-person instruction adds value for advanced levels or competition prep, but isn't necessary for most kids just learning mental math."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child gets bored with the app?",
      "answer": "Good apps like Sorokid have gamification – points, levels, achievements – that keep kids engaged. But if interest drops, it's okay to take a short break and come back."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I track my child's progress without sitting next to them?",
      "answer": "Sorokid has a parent dashboard showing what your child practiced, accuracy rates, time spent, and progress over time. You can check it anytime from your phone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this cheaper than Soroban classes?",
      "answer": "Significantly. In-person Soroban classes typically cost $50-150/month. Apps like Sorokid cost a fraction of that, plus you save on transportation time and gas."
