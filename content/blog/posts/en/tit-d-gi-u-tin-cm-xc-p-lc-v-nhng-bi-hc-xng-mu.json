    "intro": "I remember my first observation like it was yesterday, though it's been eight years. The night before, I didn't sleep. The morning of, my hands shook so badly I couldn't write on the board. For forty-five minutes, I felt like I was teaching underwater—everything distorted, slowed, surreal. When the observers finally left, I walked to the supply closet and cried. Not because the lesson went badly—honestly, I couldn't even tell you how it went—but because the pressure had been so intense that I needed to release it somehow. If you're a new teacher facing your first observation, this article is for you. I want you to know: what you're feeling is normal. The anxiety is real. And you can get through this. Here's everything I wish someone had told me before that terrifying Thursday morning.",

      }

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How do I stop shaking during my observation?",
      "answer": "Shaking is a physical anxiety response that's hard to eliminate completely. Try slow deep breathing before and during the lesson. Keep your hands busy with materials rather than letting them hang visibly. Stay hydrated. Remember that observers likely notice your nervousness far less than you think."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I forget everything during my observation?",
      "answer": "Keep brief notes visible—a simple lesson outline you can glance at. If you blank, pause and say \"Let me check my plan\" calmly. Forgetting something isn't a disaster; it's an opportunity to model recovery. Observers understand nerves affect memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I tell students about the observation?",
      "answer": "Yes, briefly. \"We'll have visitors watching our learning today\" is sufficient. Students often behave better when they know they're being observed. Don't over-explain or make students anxious about the visitors."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much sleep do I really need before an observation?",
      "answer": "Poor sleep before observations is nearly universal—don't panic about insomnia. One night of poor sleep won't significantly impair performance. Try to rest even if you can't sleep. The observation-day adrenaline will carry you through."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best lesson to teach during an observation?",
      "answer": "Choose a lesson you've taught successfully before—not a new experiment. Keep the structure simple: clear opening, straightforward activity, clean closure. Avoid technology-heavy lessons unless you're completely confident. Familiar lessons allow you to focus on students rather than content."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle a misbehaving student during observation?",
      "answer": "Use your normal management approach—observers want to see authentic teaching. Don't ignore misbehavior to avoid attention, and don't overreact to prove control. A calm, consistent response to misbehavior actually demonstrates strong classroom management."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if observers write notes constantly—does that mean I'm doing badly?",
      "answer": "Note-taking is required for documentation—it's not necessarily negative feedback. Observers write down what they see, including positive elements. Try not to interpret their expressions or note-taking during the lesson. You'll learn what they actually thought in the feedback meeting."
    },
    {
      "question": "How honest should I be about my nervousness in the feedback meeting?",
      "answer": "It's okay to acknowledge first-observation nerves: \"I was more nervous than usual—is that apparent in my teaching?\" This shows self-awareness. However, don't excuse every critique with nervousness. Focus on specific feedback and improvement strategies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I ask for feedback before the official meeting?",
      "answer": "Generally no—give observers time to complete their formal evaluation. Asking immediately can seem pushy or anxious. Wait for the scheduled meeting. If the delay is causing you significant stress, you might ask when to expect the meeting."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does observation anxiety last?",
      "answer": "Most teachers report decreased anxiety by their third or fourth formal observation. It never disappears completely—being watched is inherently uncomfortable—but it becomes manageable. Each observation survived builds confidence for the next one."
