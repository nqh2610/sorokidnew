    "intro": "I'll never forget the parent-teacher conference that made my stomach drop. 'Marcus takes significantly longer than other students to complete math assignments,' his second-grade teacher said carefully. 'He's not disruptive—he's just... slow.' That word hit like a brick. As a former math tutor who'd helped dozens of kids, watching my own son struggle with simple addition while classmates raced ahead was different. That was personal. What followed was a two-year journey of worry, research, and discovery. Because what I learned changed everything about how I understood my son's mind.",

I felt my face flush with embarrassment—and immediately felt ashamed for feeling embarrassed about my own child."

        "question": "Should I accept slowness or push for speed?",

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is it normal for a child to be slow at math?",
      "answer": "Yes, very normal. Processing speed varies widely among children and isn't related to intelligence. Many children who process slowly actually have stronger working memory and deeper analytical abilities. Speed often improves naturally with age and appropriate practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does slow math mean my child isn't smart?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not. Speed and intelligence are completely different things. Many brilliant scientists, mathematicians, and inventors were known for being deliberate, careful thinkers rather than fast ones. Einstein himself famously took his time with problems. Your child's pace says nothing about their potential."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I help my child get faster at math without pressure?",
      "answer": "Focus on building automaticity through enjoyable, consistent practice. Tools like the Japanese abacus (soroban) work wonderfully because they engage multiple senses and build muscle memory. Math games, playing cards, dice games—anything that involves numbers in a low-stakes way helps develop speed naturally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I time my child during math practice?",
      "answer": "Generally no, especially if your child shows any signs of math anxiety. Timed practice can slow progress by triggering stress responses that block learning. If you do use timing, make it completely playful rather than evaluative."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could my child have dyscalculia?",
      "answer": "Possibly, if struggles persist despite consistent support. Signs of dyscalculia include difficulty understanding quantity, trouble recognizing small groups without counting, and persistent confusion about basic number relationships. An educational psychologist can provide proper evaluation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my child do better at home than at school?",
      "answer": "This usually indicates anxiety. The school environment—time pressure, peer comparison, fear of judgment—triggers stress responses that shut down math processing abilities. Creating anxiety-free practice at home and potentially requesting school accommodations can help enormously."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is math automaticity and why does it matter?",
      "answer": "Automaticity is the ability to recall math facts instantly without conscious calculation—like knowing your name without thinking. Children without automaticity must calculate each problem from scratch, which takes time. The good news is automaticity can be built at any age with the right approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the soroban help slow math learners?",
      "answer": "The soroban transforms abstract numbers into physical movements, engaging touch, sight, and motor memory simultaneously. This multi-sensory approach builds automaticity through muscle memory rather than rote memorization. It's particularly effective for kinesthetic learners and children with math anxiety."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my child's processing speed improve with age?",
      "answer": "In most cases, yes. The brain continues developing into the mid-twenties, and processing speed typically improves throughout childhood and adolescence. What looks like 'slowness' at age seven may be completely unremarkable by twelve. Focus on building strong foundations now."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my child needs professional evaluation?",
      "answer": "Consider evaluation if struggles persist despite consistent, appropriate support; your child shows signs of distress beyond normal frustration; there are additional learning concerns in other areas; or your instinct tells you something more specific is going on. Early identification leads to better support."
