    "intro": "As a child psychologist who has worked with hundreds of families over 15 years, I've seen how learning obstacles can derail children's progress in any subject. When I introduced soroban to my own four children, I was determined to avoid the common pitfalls I'd observed professionally. Through that experience - and watching countless other families learn soroban - I've compiled this comprehensive guide to the eight most damaging mistakes and their solutions. The good news? Every single one is fixable.",

      {
        "question": "What if bad habits are already formed?",

Most bad habits can be corrected within 4-8 weeks of consistent correct practice."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know which mistakes my child is making?",
        "answer": "Watch them practice occasionally - not to critique, but to observe. Check accuracy statistics in the Sorokid app. If accuracy is low or progress seems stalled, there's likely a fundamental issue. Common signs include: frequent errors on problems they 'know,' inconsistent speed, visible frustration, or avoiding practice."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I correct every mistake immediately?",
        "answer": "No - pick 1-2 issues to focus on at a time. Too many corrections are overwhelming and discouraging for children. Address the most impactful mistake first (usually fundamentals or consistency), and once that's resolved, move to the next issue. Patience and encouragement are more effective than constant correction."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What are the most common soroban learning mistakes?",
      "answer": "The eight most common mistakes are: 1) Practicing too long (sessions over 20 minutes), 2) Skipping fundamentals to reach impressive problems faster, 3) Wrong finger usage, 4) Counting beads instead of pattern recognition, 5) Skipping the reset between problems, 6) Moving to anzan (mental math) too early, 7) Inconsistent practice schedules, 8) Prioritizing speed over accuracy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should soroban practice sessions be?",
      "answer": "Optimal practice duration varies by age: 10-15 minutes for ages 5-6, 15-20 minutes for ages 7-8, and 20-25 minutes for ages 9+. Research shows short, consistent daily sessions build skills better than longer, occasional sessions. Always end while the child is still engaged, not exhausted."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the correct finger technique for soroban?",
      "answer": "Correct technique uses only thumb and index finger. The thumb pushes earth beads UP toward the beam. The index finger pushes ALL beads DOWN (both heaven and earth beads). Middle, ring, and pinky fingers should rest naturally and not be used for bead manipulation. Correct technique from the beginning prevents problems later."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should my child start anzan (mental soroban)?",
      "answer": "Children should spend a minimum of 3-6 months on physical soroban before attempting anzan. Signs of readiness include: calculating without looking at fingers, consistent (not variable) speed, 95%+ accuracy on physical soroban. Begin anzan with simple single-digit, two-number problems only."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is my child counting beads instead of recognizing patterns?",
      "answer": "Bead counting (saying 'one, two, three...') instead of instant pattern recognition is common in beginners who didn't spend enough time on number recognition exercises. The fix is dedicated pattern recognition practice: flash a bead pattern for 1 second, child responds immediately. No counting allowed. With repetition, any digit should be recognized in under 1 second."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I fix inconsistent soroban practice habits?",
      "answer": "Link practice to an existing daily routine (after breakfast, before screen time, after dinner). This 'habit stacking' technique makes practice automatic. Same time every day, even if just 10 minutes. Research shows daily 15-minute sessions produce better results than three 35-minute sessions per week."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I focus on speed or accuracy when my child learns soroban?",
      "answer": "Always accuracy first, then speed. Set accuracy targets (95%+) before speed targets. A wrong answer at high speed is still wrong, and practicing errors reinforces them. Speed develops naturally after accuracy is solid and movements become automatic. If accuracy drops when speed increases, slow back down immediately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can bad soroban habits be fixed after they're formed?",
      "answer": "Yes, all bad habits can be corrected, though it takes longer than learning correctly from the start. The approach: acknowledge that unlearning takes time, go back to basics, practice correct technique at a slower pace, be patient, and celebrate small improvements. Most habits can be corrected within 4-8 weeks of consistent practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my child is ready to advance to the next soroban level?",
      "answer": "Advance only when the current stage is automatic, not just 'understood.' The child should achieve 90%+ accuracy consistently. Signs of readiness: calculations happen without conscious thought about technique, speed is consistent (not variable), and there's no hesitation or visible effort. Rushing advancement creates compounding problems later."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I correct my child's soroban mistakes without discouraging them?",
      "answer": "Pick 1-2 mistakes to focus on at a time. Praise effort and improvement, not just results. Frame corrections positively ('Try this way' instead of 'Don't do that'). Let children self-correct when possible by asking 'Does that look right?' Never compare to siblings or other children. Celebrate small wins frequently."
