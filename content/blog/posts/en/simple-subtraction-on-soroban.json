    "intro": "After teaching addition to my three kids on the soroban, I dreaded introducing subtraction. It seemed harder, more abstract. But here's the beautiful secret I discovered: subtraction on the soroban is simply addition in reverse. Once I understood this principle – and learned how to explain it to my children – subtraction became just as intuitive as addition. In this guide, I'll share exactly how I taught simple subtraction, the common stumbling blocks, and the breakthrough moment that made it click for each of my kids.",

      {
        "question": "Why is subtraction harder than addition on the soroban?",
        "answer": "Subtraction requires a mental 'flip' – removing instead of adding. Also, the 5-complement technique appears earlier in subtraction. However, with practice, subtraction becomes just as automatic as addition."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should my child master addition before learning subtraction?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily. Many curricula teach them together since they're inverse operations. However, if subtraction causes frustration, strengthen addition skills first before returning to subtraction."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I explain the 5-complement to my child?",
        "answer": "Use the coin analogy: the heaven bead is like a nickel (5 cents). When you can't subtract directly, you trade the nickel for five pennies, remove what you need, and keep the rest."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is simple subtraction on the soroban?",
      "answer": "Simple subtraction on the soroban involves moving beads away from the central beam to represent numbers being taken away. Lower beads are pushed down with the index finger, and the upper bead is pushed up with the index finger."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 5-complement rule in soroban subtraction?",
      "answer": "The 5-complement rule is used when you need to subtract from the heaven bead (worth 5) but have no lower beads. You remove the heaven bead (subtract 5) and add back the complement. For example, 5-2: remove the heaven bead, add 3 lower beads."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which finger do I use for soroban subtraction?",
      "answer": "Use your index finger for all subtraction movements – pushing lower beads down and the heaven bead up. The thumb is only used when adding the complement (the beads you add back after using the 5-complement rule)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to learn soroban subtraction?",
      "answer": "With consistent daily practice (10-15 minutes), most children master simple subtraction within 4-6 weeks. The 5-complement often takes an additional 1-2 weeks to become automatic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is soroban subtraction the same as regular subtraction?",
      "answer": "Yes, the mathematical operation is identical. The soroban just provides a visual and tactile method for performing subtraction, making the abstract concept concrete and helping children understand the inverse relationship with addition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the 5-complement pairs for subtraction?",
      "answer": "The four 5-complement pairs are: 1 and 4, 2 and 3, 3 and 2, 4 and 1. When subtracting any of these from 5, you remove the heaven bead and add its complement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my child confuse addition and subtraction on the soroban?",
      "answer": "This is common because the movements are opposite. The key rule: addition moves beads toward the beam, subtraction moves beads away from the beam. Practice this distinction until it becomes automatic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I teach addition and subtraction at the same time?",
      "answer": "Yes, some curricula teach them together to reinforce their inverse relationship. However, if your child struggles, it's fine to master addition first before introducing subtraction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What problems should I start with for soroban subtraction?",
      "answer": "Start with direct subtraction using only lower beads: 4-1, 3-2, 4-2, 3-1. Then progress to subtracting from numbers with the heaven bead (7-2, 8-3), and finally introduce the 5-complement (5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What comes after simple soroban subtraction?",
      "answer": "After mastering single-digit subtraction, progress to two-digit subtraction (using multiple columns), the 10-complement rule (for borrowing), mixed operations, and eventually mental calculation without touching the soroban."
