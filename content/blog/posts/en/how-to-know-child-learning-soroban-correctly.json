  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "My child has been learning for 3 months with no visible progress. Is that normal?",
      "answer": "Yes, completely normal. The first 3 months are mainly about getting familiar with the abacus – learning to represent numbers and move beads correctly. Visible calculation improvements usually appear from month 4-6. Don't give up yet."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my child is truly understanding vs just memorizing?",
      "answer": "Ask them to explain: 'Why is 7+5=12?' If they can describe it using the abacus ('5 plus 5 is 10, plus 2 more is 12'), they understand. If they just recite the answer without explaining, the learning method might need adjustment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I check my child's progress?",
      "answer": "Once a month is sufficient. Don't check daily – that creates unnecessary pressure. Naturally observing through everyday situations (shopping, splitting snacks) works better than formal testing."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is progressing slower than others. Should I be concerned?",
      "answer": "No. Every child has a different pace depending on many factors. What matters is progress compared to their own past performance, not compared to others. Don't create comparison pressure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What signs indicate my child needs to adjust their learning approach?",
      "answer": "After 3-4 months still can't recognize numbers on abacus, hates every practice session, goes through motions without understanding, or speed hasn't improved after months. If you see these signs, consider adjusting: less practice time, different app, or take a break."
    },
    {
      "question": "I don't know Soroban myself. How can I monitor my child?",
      "answer": "Check app reports (Sorokid has this feature), give random quizzes on the go ('How much for 3 of these?'), compare lesson completion times to previous months, and ask your child how they feel ('Is this easier than before?')."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does it mean when my child 'looks up' while calculating?",
      "answer": "Excellent sign! They're visualizing the abacus in their mind – meaning they're transitioning to mental calculation (Anzan). I noticed my daughter doing this around month 4-5. It means something is genuinely developing in their brain."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I let my child take a break?",
      "answer": "When they're tired, bored, or have other priorities. A few days to 1-2 weeks off is perfectly fine and won't significantly impact progress. What matters is returning with a positive attitude, not feeling forced."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child doesn't want to learn anymore. What should I do?",
      "answer": "Find out why: Too hard? Too easy? Just bored? Try changing format (physical abacus to app or vice versa), reduce practice time, add games. If they're still not interested after a few weeks of adjustments, Soroban might not be right for them – and that's okay."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are normal progress milestones?",
      "answer": "Reference: Month 1-2 can read numbers on abacus; Month 3-4 calculates single-digits without finger-counting; Month 5-6 starts mental visualization; Month 7-9 mental math with 2-digit numbers; Month 10-12 faster and more confident. Each child may be faster or slower – this is just a reference."
