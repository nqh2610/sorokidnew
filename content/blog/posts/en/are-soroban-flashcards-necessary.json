    {
      "question": "Where can I buy Soroban flashcards?",
      "answer": "Search Amazon or Etsy for 'Soroban flashcards' or 'abacus flashcards.' You can also find free printable PDFs online. Prices range from $10-30 depending on quantity and quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can flashcards replace a Soroban app?",
      "answer": "No. Flashcards only help with number recognition, not actual calculation. Your child needs to learn through an app or teacher first. Flashcards are supplementary tools, not the main learning method."
    },
    {
      "question": "What age can kids use Soroban flashcards?",
      "answer": "From 5-6 years old, after they've learned numbers 0-9 on the Soroban. Before that, flashcards will be too difficult and not appropriate for their development level."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many flashcards should I buy?",
      "answer": "Start with a 50-card set for numbers 0-49. That's enough for beginners. Once your child is comfortable, you can expand to a 100-card set with larger numbers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I make my own flashcards?",
      "answer": "Yes, if you have time. Download free Soroban images, print on cardstock, and cut into cards. Downside is it takes time and may not look as polished as commercial sets."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should kids practice with flashcards daily?",
      "answer": "5-10 minutes is enough. Split into 2-3 short sessions (2-3 minutes each) is more effective than one long session. Avoid letting kids get bored from repetition."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do flashcards help with Anzan (mental math)?",
      "answer": "Indirectly, yes. Flashcards help kids memorize abacus patterns faster, which is a foundation for Anzan. But to truly learn Anzan, you need more specialized methods."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child doesn't like flashcards. What should I do?",
      "answer": "Don't force it. There are many other review methods: interactive apps, computer games, or competing with siblings. Flashcards are just one of many tools."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I make flashcard practice fun?",
      "answer": "Turn it into a game: speed guessing, who gets more correct, sorting into ascending order, categorizing even/odd numbers. Give small rewards when they do well."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are Soroban flashcards different from regular number flashcards?",
      "answer": "Soroban flashcards show abacus bead patterns instead of digits. The purpose is to help kids connect abacus images with numerical values, training for mental calculation skills later."
