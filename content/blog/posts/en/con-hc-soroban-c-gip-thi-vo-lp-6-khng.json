    "intro": "Two years before the entrance exam, I wondered if Soroban was worth continuing. My daughter already calculated faster than her classmates—wasn't that enough? Then I talked to parents of students who'd entered our target school. One mother said, 'The math section isn't hard, but it's designed so most children can't finish in time. Speed determines everything.' That conversation changed our approach. My daughter entered the exam room two years later and finished with 12 minutes to spare. She scored in the top 3% of applicants. Here's exactly what Soroban gave her that other preparation couldn't.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Does Soroban really help with 6th grade entrance exams?",
      "answer": "Yes, significantly. Entrance exam math sections are designed with tight time limits. Soroban-trained children calculate 2-3 times faster than peers, giving them time to check answers and approach problems calmly. Our daughter finished with 12 minutes to spare and scored in the top 3%."
    },
    {
      "question": "How early should we start Soroban training for entrance exams?",
      "answer": "Ideally, start 2 years before the exam (beginning of 4th grade for 6th grade entrance). This allows time to build visualization skills and integrate them with exam strategies. Even one year provides significant benefit, but two years creates near-automatic mental calculation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Soroban training enough, or do we need exam prep too?",
      "answer": "Both are needed. Soroban provides calculation speed and accuracy. Exam prep provides problem-solving strategies, question familiarity, and test-taking techniques. Together, they create complete exam readiness. Neither alone is sufficient for competitive admissions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much daily Soroban practice is needed?",
      "answer": "20 minutes daily is the sweet spot—enough for progress, short enough to maintain consistently. Consistency matters more than duration. 20 minutes every day beats 2 hours twice per week for building the neural pathways needed for automatic visualization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child already uses mental math shortcuts?",
      "answer": "Shortcuts are helpful but limited. Soroban visualization handles any numbers systematically, while shortcuts only work for specific number combinations. Entrance exams often design problems to bypass common shortcuts—Soroban's systematic approach still works in those situations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will Soroban help with the non-math sections of entrance exams?",
      "answer": "Indirectly, yes. Soroban training builds concentration, mental stamina, and focus—skills that transfer to reading comprehension and writing. Children who finish math quickly also have more mental energy for subsequent sections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Soroban training start in 5th grade if we haven't started yet?",
      "answer": "Yes, though benefits will be less complete. One year of focused practice can still provide meaningful speed advantages. Concentrate on addition/subtraction visualization first, as these appear most frequently on exams. Any Soroban skill is better than none."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do we know if Soroban training is working?",
      "answer": "Track practice test metrics: time remaining, calculation errors, and overall score. You should see improvement in all three over time. Also watch for your child calculating without writing steps—this indicates visualization is developing properly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if other children have calculators or different advantages?",
      "answer": "Entrance exams specifically prohibit calculators. All children face the same conditions. Soroban training creates an advantage that's allowed, legal, and helpful—essentially a mental calculator that can't be taken away. It's one of the fairest advantages available."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do competitive middle schools value Soroban training in applications?",
      "answer": "Some schools appreciate demonstrated dedication to skill-building activities like Soroban. However, the primary value is practical: higher exam scores from faster calculation. The competitive advantage comes from performance, not credential listing."
