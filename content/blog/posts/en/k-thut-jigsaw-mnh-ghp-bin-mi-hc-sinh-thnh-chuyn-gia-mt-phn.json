    "intro": "I used to spend an entire period explaining a complex topic, only to ask questions afterward and see blank faces. Maybe three or four students could recall what I'd taught. The rest? Lost. Then I discovered the Jigsaw technique, and everything changed. Instead of me talking while students passively listened, students became teachers themselves. Every single student became an 'expert' responsible for teaching their piece to classmates. The shift was dramatic: engagement soared, understanding deepened, and students who'd never spoken up became confident explainers. Here's exactly how Jigsaw works and how to implement it effectively in your classroom.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What grades is Jigsaw appropriate for?",
      "answer": "Jigsaw can work with students from second grade through adult learners. Younger students need simpler content, more scaffolding, smaller groups, and more practice with cooperative skills. Start with Mini-Jigsaw variations for grades 2-3, then move to full Jigsaw in grades 4+."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle students who refuse to participate?",
      "answer": "Start by understanding why—are they shy, struggling academically, or having social issues? Provide extra scaffolding and practice for reluctant students. Pair them with supportive partners. Emphasize that everyone's piece is needed. Build up gradually from partner work to small groups."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if an expert teaches incorrect information?",
      "answer": "This is a common concern. Mitigate by: checking expert groups before they disperse, providing expert sheets with accurate information, using Jigsaw II so everyone has baseline knowledge, and following up with whole-class discussion to catch and correct errors."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I grade Jigsaw activities?",
      "answer": "Use individual accountability: each student takes a quiz covering ALL segments, not just their own. This ensures everyone learns from their peers and experts take their teaching role seriously. You can also include participation grades and peer evaluations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What subjects work best with Jigsaw?",
      "answer": "Jigsaw works across subjects: social studies (different aspects of a historical event), science (parts of a system), literature (different characters or themes), math (different strategies or concepts). The key is content that can be meaningfully divided into distinct, learnable segments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many students should be in each group?",
      "answer": "Home groups typically have 4-6 students, matching the number of content segments. Expert groups can be larger (all students learning the same segment). Smaller groups mean more individual participation but require more content divisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I keep all groups on pace?",
      "answer": "Use visible timers for each phase. Circulate constantly to spot groups that are rushing or lagging. Provide early finisher activities. Have a 'parking lot' where groups can note questions to address later if they need to move on."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't have enough time for full Jigsaw?",
      "answer": "Use shortened variations: Mini-Jigsaw with 2-3 segments, Jigsaw II where pre-reading is homework, or split the process across two periods (expert groups one day, home groups the next). Consistent practice also speeds up the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Jigsaw help struggling learners?",
      "answer": "Struggling learners often thrive in Jigsaw: they learn from peers (often less intimidating than teacher), they have a specific, valued role that builds confidence, expert groups provide peer support for understanding, and explaining content to others deepens their own learning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Jigsaw be combined with technology?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Students can use devices to research in expert groups, create digital presentations for teaching, collaborate on shared documents, or even do virtual Jigsaw with breakout rooms. Technology can enhance but shouldn't overcomplicate the core process."
