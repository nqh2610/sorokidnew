    "intro": "'Any ideas?' I asked. Silence. Twenty-five students stared at me, waiting for someone else to speak first. No one wanted to be wrong. No one wanted to stand out. I'd seen this pattern for years—the fear of judgment killing creativity before ideas even had a chance to form. Then I learned to facilitate brainstorming properly. Not just 'share your thoughts' discussions, but structured brainstorming with clear rules that make safety and wild thinking possible. Now my problem isn't getting ideas—it's having too many to work through. Here's everything I've learned about unlocking creative thinking in elementary classrooms.",

    {
      "question": "How long should brainstorming sessions last?",
      "answer": "For idea generation, 5-10 minutes is usually optimal. Short time limits create productive pressure and prevent overthinking. Longer sessions often see diminishing returns. If you need more ideas, take a break and do another short session rather than one long one."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if students criticize each other's ideas?",
      "answer": "Intervene immediately and gently remind everyone of the 'no judgment' rule. Make it clear that evaluation comes LATER, not during brainstorming. If criticism continues, pause and re-establish norms. Persistent issues may need private conversations about psychological safety."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I help shy students participate in brainstorming?",
      "answer": "Use brainwriting (silent writing of ideas) or think-write-share structures that allow private thinking before public sharing. Small groups feel safer than whole class. Normalize the 'pass' option while gently inviting participation. Build safety over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can brainstorming work with young children (K-2)?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Keep sessions shorter (3-5 minutes), use concrete prompts they can relate to, emphasize the 'no wrong answers' message, and record ideas visually or through drawing. Young children are naturally creative—they just need permission to share freely."
    },
    {
      "question": "What subjects are best for brainstorming?",
      "answer": "Brainstorming works across all subjects: writing (story ideas, topic generation), math (strategy brainstorming, real-world applications), science (hypotheses, investigation ideas), social studies (solutions to problems, perspectives). Any time you want multiple ideas or approaches, brainstorming helps."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many ideas should we aim for?",
      "answer": "More is generally better—quantity leads to quality. Set ambitious targets: 15-20 ideas from a small group, 30+ from a class. Research shows that the best ideas often come after the obvious ones are exhausted, around ideas 10-15 and beyond."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do I do with all the ideas after brainstorming?",
      "answer": "Don't let ideas die on the whiteboard! Group similar ideas, vote on favorites, evaluate for feasibility, and select some to pursue. The processing phase is crucial—it's where brainstorming becomes useful. Always close the loop by doing something with the ideas generated."

      "question": "How do I prevent one or two students from dominating?",
      "answer": "Use structured formats: round-robin (one idea per turn), brainwriting (written ideas), or sticky note collection. Create rules like 'contribute then wait for three others before contributing again.' Gently redirect: 'Great ideas! Let's hear from someone new.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if brainstorming produces only silly or off-topic ideas?",
      "answer": "Some silliness is natural and often sparks creative connections. If it's excessive, clarify the focus question. Use prompts like 'What else, related to our topic?' Accept that 'wild' ideas are part of the process—sometimes the silly ones lead somewhere unexpected."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I use brainstorming in my classroom?",
      "answer": "Regular practice builds comfort and skill. Consider using brainstorming weekly or whenever you want multiple ideas: beginning of projects, solving classroom problems, generating writing topics, exploring strategies. The more students practice, the more effective they become."
