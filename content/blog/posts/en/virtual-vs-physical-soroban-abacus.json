    "intro": "\"You need a real abacus to learn Soroban!\" – That's what I thought when I decided to teach my son mental math. I went on Amazon, ordered a $15 wooden Soroban right away. When it arrived, my son excitedly opened it and slid the beads around. Then... 2 weeks later it sat in a corner collecting dust. I asked myself: Where did I go wrong?",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is a real Soroban absolutely necessary for learning?",
      "answer": "Not required. An app with virtual abacus is enough to learn from basic to advanced. A physical one is nice-to-have for tactile experience, but doesn't determine whether your child can learn or not."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of physical Soroban should I buy and how much?",
      "answer": "Choose 13-17 rods, plastic or wooden beads that slide smoothly and stay in place. $15-30 is reasonable. Don't go below $10 – beads will fall off and break quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What age can kids use a virtual abacus?",
      "answer": "From 5-6 years old, when they can count numbers and use a phone/iPad basically. With virtual abacus in apps, they just tap the screen to slide beads – very easy to operate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the virtual abacus good for my child's eyes?",
      "answer": "If used for appropriate durations (15-20 minutes/day), it doesn't affect eyesight. Important to take breaks between sessions and not let kids use screens too long."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which app has a good virtual Soroban?",
      "answer": "Sorokid has a free virtual Soroban abacus with leveled exercises from basic to advanced. Kids can self-learn without parents knowing Soroban. You can try before deciding to buy a physical one."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can my child learn Soroban with just the virtual version?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Many children learn Soroban entirely through apps and progress to mental math (Anzan) without ever using a physical abacus. The ultimate goal is calculating in your head anyway."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child prefers the physical abacus. Should I force the app?",
      "answer": "No need to force. But you'll need to sit with them to provide feedback since physical abacuses don't auto-grade. Consider using both: app for daily practice (with guidance), physical for variety."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using only the app mean my child misses something?",
      "answer": "The only thing missing is tactile sensation. However, the goal of Soroban is mental visualization anyway – which the app teaches equally well or better due to built-in Anzan training modes."
    },
    {
      "question": "I already bought a physical Soroban. Should I still get an app?",
      "answer": "Yes! Use the app for daily practice (guidance, exercises, feedback) and the physical Soroban for occasional practice or testing. They complement each other well."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long before my child can do mental math without any abacus?",
      "answer": "Varies by child, but typically 6-12 months of consistent practice. The app helps transition to mental math (Anzan) with progressive fading modes that gradually hide the abacus."
