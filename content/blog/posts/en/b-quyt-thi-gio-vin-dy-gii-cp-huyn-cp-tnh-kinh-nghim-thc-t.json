  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long should I prepare for a teaching competition?",
      "answer": "Serious preparation requires minimum 6 months. Use month 1-2 for knowledge building, months 3-4 for skill practice, and months 5-6 for refinement and rehearsal. Starting earlier allows for genuine classroom experiments that can become your innovation project."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the most important component of the competition?",
      "answer": "The demonstration lesson typically carries the most weight (40-50% of score) and is where strong teachers distinguish themselves. However, neglecting written exams or the innovation project can cost you the overall win even with an excellent lesson."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I prepare for teaching unfamiliar students?",
      "answer": "Practice! Ask colleagues if you can teach their classes. Develop techniques for quickly learning names, establishing rapport, and reading the room. Create 'universal' engagement activities that work with any group. The more you practice with unknown students, the more comfortable you become."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes a demonstration lesson stand out?",
      "answer": "Visible student engagement, clear pedagogical purpose for every activity, smooth time management, genuine connection with students, and evidence that learning actually occurred. Avoid over-complication—a well-executed simple lesson beats a chaotic ambitious one."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle nerves during the competition?",
      "answer": "Preparation is the best anxiety reducer. Beyond that: establish a calming routine, visualize successful performance, remember that judges want you to succeed, and focus on students rather than judges during your lesson. Have contingency plans for common problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should my innovation project demonstrate?",
      "answer": "Your project should show: a clear problem you identified, a systematic approach to solving it, evidence of implementation, measurable impact on student learning, honest reflection on limitations, and potential for other teachers to replicate your approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is provincial competition different from district?",
      "answer": "Provincial level has higher expectations, tougher competition (you're facing district winners), more expert judges, and greater scrutiny of every element. What was 'excellent' at district level becomes 'expected' at provincial. Double your preparation intensity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I win without natural teaching talent?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Teaching competitions test specific, learnable skills—not innate talent. Systematic preparation, deliberate practice, and learning from feedback can develop anyone's competitive teaching abilities. My own journey from 15th place proves this."
    },
    {
      "question": "What digital tools help in competition demonstration lessons?",
      "answer": "Random student pickers, digital timers, interactive polling tools, and engagement games like spinner wheels all create visible participation. These tools show pedagogical sophistication while genuinely improving lesson dynamics. Practice with them until use is seamless."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get honest feedback on my teaching?",
      "answer": "Record yourself and watch critically. Ask trusted colleagues for specific feedback, not just 'good job.' Find previous competition winners willing to observe you. Some regions offer pre-competition coaching sessions. The more perspectives you gather, the more blind spots you'll discover."
