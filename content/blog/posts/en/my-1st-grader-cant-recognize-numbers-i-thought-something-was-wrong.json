  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is it normal for my child to confuse 6 and 9?",
      "answer": "Completely normal for ages 5-7. This is when the brain is developing spatial and directional recognition. Most children naturally grow out of this by end of 1st grade or 2nd grade as their brains mature."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I actually get my child tested?",
      "answer": "If by end of 2nd or 3rd grade they still frequently reverse numbers, have trouble with reading too, show no improvement despite practice, or display serious stress when learning – then see an educational psychologist. First graders reversing numbers is almost always normal development."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I help my child tell 6 from 9?",
      "answer": "Use multiple senses: let them touch raised plastic numbers, use different colors for each number, create fun images ('6 has belly at bottom like pregnant lady, 9 has head on top like bald grandpa'). Practice writing in the air before paper. Most importantly, don't scold when they get it wrong."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child writes 3 backwards like the letter E. Is that a problem?",
      "answer": "Not a problem – this also shows the brain hasn't fully distinguished left from right. Use memory tricks: 'Number 3 has two bellies facing right, like you're looking forward.' Practice and patience, and they'll remember."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is dyscalculia? Does my child have it?",
      "answer": "Dyscalculia is a learning disorder affecting the ability to understand and work with numbers, occurring in 3-6% of children. However, it's only diagnosed after a child has had sufficient learning time (usually after 2nd grade) and still shows serious difficulties. A 1st grader reversing numbers is normal development, not dyscalculia."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my child also confuse b and d?",
      "answer": "Same reason – the brain is still developing directional recognition. B and d are mirror images, just like 6 and 9. This skill develops gradually and usually matures around ages 7-8. The same strategies work: touch, colors, memory stories."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child's classmates don't have this problem. Is my child behind?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Every child's brain develops at its own pace. Some develop spatial recognition earlier, some later. Just because classmates aren't reversing numbers doesn't mean your child has a problem – they're just on their own timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will it take for my child to stop reversing numbers?",
      "answer": "With consistent practice using the right techniques (touch, colors, images, patience), most children improve within 1-3 months. By end of 1st grade or early 2nd grade, the issue usually resolves completely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I practice more with my child every day?",
      "answer": "Quality over quantity. 5-10 minutes of focused, fun practice is better than 30 minutes of frustrating drill. Keep it playful, use games, and stop before they get tired or frustrated."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tools help with number recognition?",
      "answer": "Raised plastic numbers for touch, colored number charts, apps with visual learning (like Sorokid which uses Soroban to visualize numbers), play-dough for making numbers, and simple games like number bingo or scavenger hunts."
    }
