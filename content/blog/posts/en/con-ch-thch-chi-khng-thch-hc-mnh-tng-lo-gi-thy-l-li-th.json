  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why does my child only want to play and not study?",
      "answer": "This is developmentally normal. Young children's brains are wired to learn through play, exploration, and hands-on experience—not sitting still for lectures. The urge to play isn't laziness; it's biology. Work WITH this instinct rather than against it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is play-based learning as effective as traditional study?",
      "answer": "Research shows play-based learning is often MORE effective for young children. Play triggers dopamine, enhancing memory formation, while forced study triggers stress hormones that impair learning. Children also practice more when engaged, leading to better skill development."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if an educational game is actually teaching?",
      "answer": "Look for: genuine gameplay (not drill disguised as games), adaptive difficulty, progress tracking you can review, alignment with curriculum standards, and whether your child voluntarily returns to play. Observable skill improvement over time confirms learning is happening."
    },
    {
      "question": "Won't my child become lazy if I don't make them do traditional homework?",
      "answer": "Children who enjoy learning through play often develop BETTER learning habits than those forced into early formal study. Positive associations with learning create intrinsic motivation. They'll tolerate less exciting tasks better because they know learning can be enjoyable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much screen time is okay for educational games?",
      "answer": "Quality matters more than quantity within reasonable limits. 20-40 minutes of active educational engagement daily is different from passive video watching. Set boundaries, take breaks, and ensure balance with physical play, reading, and social activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child sees through 'drill disguised as games.' What do I do?",
      "answer": "Look for games designed as games first, where learning is embedded in genuinely fun gameplay rather than worksheets with cartoon characters. Quality educational games don't feel like studying—kids don't realize they're learning because they're focused on the game goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "At what age should children transition to traditional study methods?",
      "answer": "There's no fixed age—it depends on the child. Most children gradually accept more traditional formats around ages 7-9 as attention spans increase. The key is maintaining positive associations. Even older students benefit from gamified review and active learning methods."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can play-based learning prepare my child for school?",
      "answer": "Yes. Many schools now incorporate play-based learning, especially in early grades. Children who learn through play often enter school with stronger number sense, better problem-solving skills, and healthier attitudes toward learning than those drilled with worksheets prematurely."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I balance educational games with other activities?",
      "answer": "Treat educational games as ONE learning tool, not the only one. Balance with physical play, outdoor time, reading, creative activities, and social interaction. A varied approach develops the whole child while making each activity feel fresh and engaging."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my spouse thinks games are 'cheating' at education?",
      "answer": "Share research on play-based learning with them. Point to observable results: Is your child's skill improving? Are they voluntarily engaging? Do they have positive associations with learning? Results matter more than method appearance."
