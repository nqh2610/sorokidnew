    "intro": "The first time I watched the viral video—a child adding 15 numbers in under 10 seconds, fingers dancing on invisible beads—I was skeptical. 'It's a trick,' I thought. 'Or they've memorized the answers.' As a neuroscientist, I pride myself on being evidence-based. So when my daughter Emma started soroban at age 6, I watched closely. Two years later, she can add five 3-digit numbers faster than I can type them into my phone. Her fingers move in the air, her eyes close briefly, and the answer appears. This isn't magic—it's anzan. And understanding the neuroscience behind it has made me a complete believer.",

      "question": "How long does it take to develop anzan?",
      "answer": "Basic anzan (simple problems) typically emerges after 3-6 months of consistent practice. Reliable visualization for 2-digit problems takes 6-12 months. Fluent anzan for complex calculations usually requires 18-24+ months."

    {
      "question": "Why do children move their fingers during anzan?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is flash anzan?",
      "answer": "Flash anzan shows numbers on screen for fractions of a second—too fast for verbal processing. The brain must instantly convert numbers to bead patterns and add them visually. Top practitioners can add 15+ numbers flashing at 100-200 milliseconds each."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is anzan necessary to benefit from soroban?",
      "answer": "No. Even without elite anzan, soroban provides benefits: better number sense, faster calculation with physical tools, improved concentration, and confidence. Anzan is impressive but not required for meaningful success."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is anzan faster than traditional mental math?",
      "answer": "Anzan processes information in parallel—multiple beads/columns can update simultaneously in the visual image. Traditional mental math is sequential—each step waits for the previous one. Visual processing is inherently faster than verbal."

    {
      "question": "At what age can children start developing anzan?",
      "answer": "Anzan develops naturally from physical soroban practice. Children starting soroban at ages 5-8 have the best chance of developing strong visualization. The brain's plasticity during these years makes visual pattern formation easier."

    {
      "question": "How can I encourage my child's anzan development?",
