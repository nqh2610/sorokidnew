    "intro": "'What's 7 plus 8?' '14!' 'WRONG! How many times have we been over this? Why don't you pay attention?' That was me, yelling at my daughter for months. Every time she got mental math wrong, I blamed her—lazy, careless, not trying hard enough. Until a teacher told me: 'She's not making mistakes because she's lazy. She's making mistakes because she doesn't have the foundation.' That one sentence completely changed how I understood my daughter's struggle.",

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why does my child make constant mental math errors?",
      "answer": "Most 'careless' errors happen because children lack automaticity—they're calculating each problem from scratch rather than knowing answers instantly. Calculation is slow and error-prone, especially under time pressure. Building automaticity through targeted practice solves this."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between knowing a math fact and having automaticity?",
      "answer": "Knowing means being able to figure out 7+8=15 by counting. Automaticity means instantly knowing it's 15 without any calculation—like knowing your own name. Automaticity frees mental energy for higher-level thinking and eliminates counting errors."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my child lacks math fact automaticity?",
      "answer": "Signs include: finger counting for basic facts, counting up/down instead of knowing answers, inconsistent results on the same problems, much slower than peers, errors usually off by 1-2 (miscounting), and worse performance under time pressure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does more practice always help with mental math?",
      "answer": "Only if it's the right kind of practice. Random mixed practice of facts your child already knows doesn't help. Focused practice on specific weak combinations, in short frequent sessions with game-like engagement, builds the missing automaticity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use timed drills to build speed?",
      "answer": "Not initially. Timed pressure before automaticity creates anxious guessing and more errors. Build accuracy first through untimed practice. Once facts are automatic, speed comes naturally. Add gentle timing only after foundations are solid."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should practice sessions be?",
      "answer": "Short and frequent beats long and rare. 5 minutes, 3 times daily is better than 30 minutes once. Brief sessions with breaks allow the brain to consolidate without fatigue, and multiple exposures throughout the day accelerate automaticity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are games better than worksheets for building automaticity?",
      "answer": "Games provide the same repetition as worksheets but without anxiety. Anxiety impairs learning and memory. Games also maintain engagement longer, provide immediate feedback, and create positive associations with math practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "What number combinations should I focus on?",
      "answer": "Test which combinations your child knows instantly vs. needs to calculate. Common gaps are: 'making 10' combinations (6+4, 7+3), 'crossing 10' additions (8+5, 7+6), and related subtraction facts. Focus practice on the specific gaps, not random facts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can older children still build automaticity they missed earlier?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. It's never too late. Older children may actually progress faster because of better attention spans and motivation. The key is making practice age-appropriate and non-embarrassing—apps and games help keep it pressure-free."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is automaticity related to higher math success?",
      "answer": "Basic math facts are the foundation for everything else. If addition isn't automatic, subtraction is harder. If multiplication isn't automatic, division, fractions, and algebra become struggles. Investing in automaticity early pays dividends throughout math education."
