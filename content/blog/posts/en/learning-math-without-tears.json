    "intro": "The night I found my seven-year-old hiding under her bed to avoid homework, something broke in me. Not my patience—that had broken long ago. Something deeper. The belief that this was how learning had to be. Sophie and I had been locked in nightly homework battles for over a year. I'd push. She'd resist. I'd push harder. She'd cry. I'd lose my temper. She'd shut down. By bedtime, we were both exhausted, our relationship fraying, and the math—the whole point of this exercise—barely done. I was a family therapist. I helped other parents navigate exactly these situations. And I couldn't solve my own. The irony wasn't lost on me. But sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom to see the problem clearly. What I discovered changed not just our homework routine, but my entire understanding of how children learn.",

        "question": "Won't they fall behind without pushing?",
        "answer": "They're already falling behind if they hate math. A child who practices 10 minutes daily willingly will dramatically outperform one who fights through 30 tearful minutes. Willingness creates learning; resistance blocks it."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long until I see results?",
        "answer": "Emotional results (less resistance) often appear in 2-4 weeks if you're consistent. Academic results take longer—typically 2-3 months. Trust the process; the daily practice seems ineffective until it suddenly isn't."

    }
  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why does my child cry every time we do math homework?",
      "answer": "Usually it's a combination of factors: timing (doing homework when they're depleted), duration (sessions that feel endless), pressure (parental stress they absorb), and accumulated negative associations. Address each factor systematically—shorter sessions, better timing, calmer approach—and the tears typically reduce within 2-4 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should homework take without causing meltdowns?",
      "answer": "There's no universal answer—find your child's threshold. Start with an amount so short they don't resist (even 3-5 minutes), then add time gradually only when current duration feels easy. Ten minutes of willing practice beats thirty minutes of tearful resistance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What time of day is best for math practice?",
      "answer": "Every child is different, but after school is often the worst time—they're depleted from the school day. Experiment with mornings (fresh brain), right after school with a snack, or weekend mornings. Find when your child is most receptive and protect that time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my child fall behind if I stop pushing?",
      "answer": "They're already falling behind if they hate math. Resistance blocks learning; willingness enables it. A child who practices 10 minutes daily without tears will outperform one who fights through 30 minutes of stress. Less pressure often means more learning."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I stay calm when my child is having a meltdown?",
      "answer": "Remove yourself briefly if needed—60 seconds of deep breathing helps. Remember that your stress amplifies theirs. Focus on connection before correction. If you can't stay calm, it's better to pause and try again later than to escalate together."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I reward my child for completing math homework?",
      "answer": "Rewards for completion can work short-term but may undermine intrinsic motivation long-term. Better approach: celebrate effort, not outcomes. 'You sat down and tried' matters more than 'you got them all right.' Acknowledge the struggle, not just the success."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child says they hate math?",
      "answer": "This usually means 'I hate how math makes me feel' or 'I hate how we do math.' Address the feeling first. Validate the frustration. Then systematically change the approach: shorter, less pressure, different time, more autonomy. The 'hate' often dissolves when the experience changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see results from a gentler approach?",
      "answer": "Emotional results (less resistance, fewer tears) often appear within 2-4 weeks if you're consistent. Academic improvement takes longer—typically 2-3 months. Trust the process; daily willing practice compounds even when you can't see it yet."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I help with homework or let them struggle?",
      "answer": "Be present but not controlling. Don't explain endlessly—that adds pressure. Let tools or teachers do the teaching; you provide emotional support and encouragement. Help when asked, but let them experience productive struggle. Your role is scaffolding, not solving."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it okay if my child is behind in math?",
      "answer": "Being 'behind' is less important than the trajectory. A child who's behind but engaged and improving will catch up. A child who's on level but hating math will fall behind eventually. Focus on building a positive relationship with math; the scores follow."
