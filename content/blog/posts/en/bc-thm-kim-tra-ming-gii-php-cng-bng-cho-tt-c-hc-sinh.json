    "intro": "I was the teacher who always called on the same kids. The eager hand-raisers. The students in the front rows. The ones who made eye contact. Then one day, a quiet girl in the back said something that haunted me: 'Mr. Parker, you've never called on me.' She was right. In three months, I'd never once asked her a question. That moment changed everything about how I run classroom participation.",

        "question": "What if a student has severe anxiety about being called on?",
        "answer": "Talk to them privately. Some accommodations: give them a heads-up before class that they'll be called, allow written responses, or let them 'pass' once per class with the understanding they'll contribute another way. Work with school counselors for severe cases."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is a random name picker for classrooms?",
      "answer": "A random name picker is a tool that selects student names without bias. It can be digital (spinning wheel apps, random generators) or physical (popsicle sticks, cards). It ensures every student has equal opportunity to participate and prevents teachers from unconsciously favoring certain students."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why should teachers use random student selection?",
      "answer": "Research shows teachers unconsciously favor certain students—typically hand-raisers, center-front seats, and outgoing personalities. Random selection ensures equity: every student gets equal opportunities to participate, practice speaking, and demonstrate knowledge."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does random calling improve classroom participation?",
      "answer": "When students know they might be called randomly, they pay closer attention and prepare better. It prevents 'hiding'—students can't assume they won't be called. Overall engagement increases as participation becomes truly democratic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best random name picker tools for teachers?",
      "answer": "Popular options include: Wheel of Names (free, visual spinning wheel), Sorokid's random selector (built for classrooms), ClassDojo random picker, Google Slides add-ons, and physical popsicle sticks as backup. Choose based on visual appeal and integration with your existing tools."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle anxious students with random calling?",
      "answer": "Provide support systems: think time before answers, peer support options, acceptance of partial answers, and graceful handling of 'stuck' moments. Talk privately with severely anxious students about accommodations. Often, predictable random calling reduces anxiety compared to unpredictable teacher choices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I remove names after they're picked?",
      "answer": "Depends on your goal. For ensuring everyone participates once, remove names. For ongoing questioning, leave names in—true randomness means occasional repeats. Track participation over time to ensure balance regardless of method."
    },
    {
      "question": "Doesn't random calling punish eager students?",
      "answer": "No—eager students still get called; they just don't monopolize. Create other outlets for them: written responses, discussion partners, voluntary share-outs after random selections, or leadership roles in group activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if a randomly selected student doesn't know the answer?",
      "answer": "This is valuable data! Scaffold with hints, allow peer help, or acknowledge the gap and move on gracefully. 'I don't know yet' should be acceptable. The goal is engagement and learning, not embarrassment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I introduce random name picking to my class?",
      "answer": "Explain the purpose: fairness and equal opportunity. Set expectations: everyone will be called, wrong answers are learning opportunities, 'I don't know' is acceptable with support. Make the first few experiences positive. Students typically adjust within 1-2 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is teacher bias in calling on students?",
      "answer": "Teachers unconsciously favor students who raise hands, sit in front-center 'action zones,' are outgoing, or make eye contact. Research shows boys get called 10% more than girls. Without intentional systems, bias is inevitable—even among well-meaning teachers."
