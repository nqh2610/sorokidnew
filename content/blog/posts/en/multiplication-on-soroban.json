    "intro": "As a middle school math teacher for 15 years, I've watched hundreds of students struggle with multiplication. The times tables feel arbitrary. Multi-digit multiplication seems like magic. Then I discovered the soroban and taught it to my own four children. Suddenly, multiplication made sense. They could see why 23 × 4 = 92, not just memorize it. In this guide, I'll share the exact methods I've used to teach soroban multiplication – from basic times tables through complex multi-digit problems – and explain why this visual approach creates deeper mathematical understanding.",

    },
    {
      "question": "When should my child start learning soroban multiplication?",
      "answer": "Children should start soroban multiplication after 2-3 months of solid addition and subtraction practice, when carrying is automatic, and when they know basic times tables (at least 1-5). Most children are ready between ages 7-9."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you multiply two-digit numbers on the soroban?",
      "answer": "Multiply the tens digit first and set that product, then multiply the ones digit and add to the running total. For example, 23×4: First 2×4=8 (set as 80), then 3×4=12 (add to get 92)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is soroban multiplication better than traditional methods?",
      "answer": "Soroban multiplication makes place value visible and tactile. Children see WHY multiplication works, not just HOW to do it. This deeper understanding transfers to mental math and helps with school mathematics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can soroban multiplication help with times tables memorization?",
      "answer": "Yes! The repetitive nature of soroban multiplication practice reinforces times tables through use. Many children who struggle with rote memorization learn times tables more easily through soroban practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between soroban multiplication and long multiplication?",
      "answer": "The underlying logic is identical – both use partial products. The difference is that soroban multiplication is performed physically with beads, making the place value and carrying process visible and concrete."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does soroban multiplication lead to mental math?",
      "answer": "After sufficient practice, children visualize the soroban in their minds and 'see' the beads moving during calculation. This mental visualization enables rapid mental multiplication without any physical tool."
    },
    {
      "question": "What mistakes are common in soroban multiplication?",
      "answer": "Common mistakes include forgetting place value (treating 2 tens as just 2), skipping partial products, carrying errors, and working right-to-left instead of left-to-right. Consistent practice and verbalization help prevent these."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until my child can do mental multiplication?",
      "answer": "Most children begin showing mental calculation abilities after 6-12 months of consistent soroban practice. The transition happens gradually as they internalize the bead visualization."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should my child learn multiplication on physical soroban or app?",
      "answer": "Both work well. Physical sorobans provide tactile feedback, while apps like Sorokid offer progress tracking and structured lessons. Many families use both – physical for learning, app for practice."
