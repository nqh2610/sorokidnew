    {
      "question": "If I don't solve problems for him, what if he can't do it?",
      "answer": "Ask back: 'Try looking at the problem again' or 'What do you think the first step is?' If he still can't, maybe the problem is too hard and he needs foundational skills first. Don't rush to solve it for him."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child always says 'I don't know' without trying. What do I do?",
      "answer": "He might lack confidence or fear being wrong. Reassure him: 'It's okay, just try. Being wrong is fine.' Give him a safe space to try without getting yelled at for mistakes. Gradually he'll dare to try more."
    },
    {
      "question": "My spouse yells at our child during study time. What should I do?",
      "answer": "Discuss privately, not in front of the child. Share what you've learned about child psychology, agree on a common approach. Change takes time – be patient and consistent."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know which online learning tool is good?",
      "answer": "Try the free version first. See if your child is interested and self-motivated. Check if there's progress tracking. A good tool is one that fits YOUR child – there's no one-size-fits-all best."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes a stable learning environment?",
      "answer": "Own study corner, quiet, well-lit. Same time every day. TV off, phones away during study. Enough supplies. Most important is consistency – same routine every day."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I praise effort correctly?",
      "answer": "Praise specific actions: 'You've been focusing for a while, great job', 'This was hard but you didn't give up', 'You were more self-motivated today than yesterday'. Avoid vague 'you're so smart'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is comparing my child to others bad?",
      "answer": "Comparison doesn't motivate – it creates insecurity or pressure. If you want to compare, compare with himself: 'You did this faster than yesterday!' That's positive encouragement."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child depends on me too much and won't try on his own?",
      "answer": "Gradually 'step back'. Instead of answering right away, ask: 'What do you think?' Wait 30 seconds before giving hints. Gradually increase wait time. He'll get used to thinking first."
    },
    {
      "question": "I come home from work exhausted. No energy to tutor.",
      "answer": "That's exactly when you need support tools. Let your child self-learn with an app, you just need to encourage for 5 minutes. No need to sit for an hour. Quality matters more than time quantity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I force study when we're both exhausted?",
      "answer": "No. Late evening, everyone's drained – forcing study only creates conflict, child won't absorb anything. Better to do it tomorrow morning or skip one session. One stressful session can ruin many future ones."
