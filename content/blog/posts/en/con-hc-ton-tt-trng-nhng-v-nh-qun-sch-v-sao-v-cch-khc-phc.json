The teacher had just texted saying he caught on quickly in class. How could he forget something he learned just hours ago? I thought he was faking, not paying attention. But after researching, I discovered: this is exactly how children's brains work—and I'd been reviewing wrong.",

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why does my child forget what they learned at school by evening?",
      "answer": "This is the 'forgetting curve' in action—without review, we naturally lose 50-70% of new information within hours. It's biology, not laziness. Strategic same-day review prevents this information loss."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is spaced repetition and how does it help?",
      "answer": "Spaced repetition is reviewing material at strategically timed intervals. Each review 'resets' the forgetting curve, making subsequent forgetting slower. It's the most scientifically proven method for long-term memory retention."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to review what my child learned?",
      "answer": "The most critical review window is within hours of initial learning—ideally on the car ride home or before dinner. Then review the next day, a few days later, after a week, and after 2-4 weeks for full consolidation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should review sessions be?",
      "answer": "Short is better—5-10 minutes when timed correctly beats 30 minutes of fading attention. Multiple brief reviews throughout the day are more effective than one long session."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does sleep affect how well children remember?",
      "answer": "Yes, significantly. Memory consolidation happens during sleep. Children who get inadequate or poor-quality sleep forget more. Consistent bedtimes and age-appropriate sleep duration (9-12 hours for elementary) support learning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between understanding and remembering?",
      "answer": "Understanding happens in the moment (encoding). Remembering requires transferring that understanding to long-term memory (consolidation) and being able to access it later (retrieval). Your child can understand perfectly in class but still forget without proper consolidation through review."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if forgetting is normal or a sign of a problem?",
      "answer": "Normal forgetting responds to spaced repetition strategies. Be concerned if: child forgets things immediately (not just by evening), forgetting is inconsistent, strategies don't help after 2-3 months, or forgetting affects multiple life areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the teach-back method?",
      "answer": "Having your child explain what they learned as if teaching you. This forces retrieval (powerful for memory), reveals understanding gaps, and gives you insight into what they're learning—all while serving as effective review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can apps help with spaced repetition?",
      "answer": "Yes. Well-designed educational apps use spaced repetition algorithms to present material at optimal intervals automatically. This takes the planning burden off parents while ensuring concepts are reviewed before being forgotten."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I review material in the same way each time?",
      "answer": "No—varying the format helps. Use flashcards one time, verbal questions another, app games, writing, physical manipulatives. Different formats create multiple memory pathways, making recall more robust."
