Still C's. I was so disappointed, almost gave up. Then I researched more and realized: I had wrong expectations from the start.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long until Soroban improves math grades?",
      "answer": "Varies by child and test type. Usually see improvement in calculation section after 3-6 months. Overall grades may take longer because they depend on other factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Soroban help with word problems?",
      "answer": "Soroban helps the calculation part – processing numbers. But to solve word problems, kids need to understand the question and set up the equation. That's a different skill."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I do Soroban or review school work?",
      "answer": "Both. Soroban builds mental math foundation. School review keeps up with curriculum. They complement each other, don't exclude each other."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my child do Soroban but still fail tests?",
      "answer": "Math tests have multiple parts: calculation, reading comprehension, geometry, presentation. Soroban only helps calculation. Need to supplement other skills."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child calculates fast but grades are still low – is that normal?",
      "answer": "Normal. Math grades don't come only from calculation. They might miss points from not understanding questions, forgetting formulas, or wrong presentation. Analyze their test to see where."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Soroban help with geometry?",
      "answer": "Not directly. Soroban focuses on add, subtract, multiply, divide. Geometry needs separate learning through school materials or other resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I expect from Soroban?",
      "answer": "Expect faster mental math, more confidence with numbers, better focus. Don't expect perfect scores after 3 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I quit Soroban if grades don't improve?",
      "answer": "Not yet. Analyze where your child makes errors. If calculation is correct, Soroban is working. Need to supplement other skills for overall improvement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What percentage of math tests is pure calculation?",
      "answer": "Varies by grade and test. Usually 20-40% is pure calculation. Rest is word problems, geometry, reasoning. So even perfect calculation can still mean B grades."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Soroban a waste of time if it doesn't raise grades immediately?",
      "answer": "No. Soroban builds skills that benefit math long-term, even if short-term grades don't reflect it. The foundation matters more than quick fixes."
