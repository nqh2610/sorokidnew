    {
      "question": "Is my child slow because of ADHD?",
      "answer": "Possibly, but not always. ADHD typically comes with not sitting still, getting distracted, forgetting things. If your child focuses well but is still slow, it could be processing speed or lack of math fluency – different from ADHD."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is slow but rarely makes mistakes. Should I push them to be faster?",
      "answer": "Don't push. Instead, help them SEE the benefit of being faster (finishing early to double-check, not leaving questions blank). Pushing creates pressure, leading to anxiety and working even slower."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until my child improves their speed?",
      "answer": "Usually 2-3 months of consistent practice shows noticeable improvement. But it depends on the cause: if it's math facts, 1 month and you'll see a difference. If it's fear of mistakes (psychological), it takes longer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I give my child practice tests at home?",
      "answer": "Yes, but DON'T create pressure. The purpose: getting used to time limits, not evaluation. Afterward, ask: 'How did that feel?' instead of 'Why only 70%?'"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child works fast but makes lots of mistakes?",
      "answer": "The opposite problem – they need to learn to SLOW DOWN and check more carefully. Every child has different issues. Fast but error-prone kids need accuracy practice, not speed practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does being slow mean my child isn't smart?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not. Processing speed is NOT related to IQ or thinking ability. Einstein and Edison were both described as 'slow' as children. Working slow ≠ being less intelligent."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to make times tables reflexive?",
      "answer": "Each table needs about 2 weeks of consistent practice (5 min/day) to become reflexive. All 9 tables: 2-3 months. Using an app like Sorokid speeds this up because kids enjoy practicing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Sorokid help my child work faster?",
      "answer": "Sorokid drills math facts (multiplication, addition, subtraction) with countdown timers. Kids must answer quickly to advance. Gamification makes kids WANT to practice. Gradually, reflexes become faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I talk to the teacher?",
      "answer": "Yes. The teacher can: give your child extra time (if policy allows), encourage instead of rush, understand your child is trying hard. Important: don't complain, ASK FOR SUPPORT."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is in 5th grade. Is it too late to improve?",
      "answer": "Not too late, but needs immediate priority because middle school has longer tests and shorter time limits. 3 months of proper practice before 6th grade will make a big difference."
