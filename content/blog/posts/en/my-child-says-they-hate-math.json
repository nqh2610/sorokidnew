    "intro": "The words hit me like a slap. 'I HATE MATH! I'm not doing it and you can't make me!' My eight-year-old daughter Lily slammed her homework folder shut and burst into tears. This wasn't the first time. It wasn't even the tenth time. But something about the raw desperation in her voice that evening made me realize: we had a serious problem. And worse—I'd been handling it completely wrong for months. What followed was a six-month journey of trial and error, research, failure, and finally—breakthrough. If your child is telling you they hate math, I hope our story helps you avoid the mistakes I made.",

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why does my child say they hate math?",
      "answer": "When children say they hate math, they're usually expressing frustration, anxiety, embarrassment, or feeling overwhelmed—not a rational assessment of mathematics. It's an emotional statement that needs validation before it can change. Understanding the underlying cause is the first step to helping."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I respond when my child says 'I hate math'?",
      "answer": "Start with validation: 'It sounds like math is really frustrating you right now.' Avoid correcting, lecturing, or dismissing. Once they feel heard, gently ask questions to understand what specifically is triggering their feelings. The goal is to keep communication open, not to argue them out of their feelings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a child who hates math ever learn to like it?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Feelings about math often change when the approach changes. Many children who hated math with worksheets and tests discover they enjoy it through games, physical tools like the soroban, or real-world applications. The goal is finding what works for your specific child."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I force my child to do math if they hate it?",
      "answer": "Yes, but adjust the approach. Completely avoiding math reinforces avoidance. Instead, make sessions brief (10-15 minutes), low-pressure, and if possible, different from what's causing the hatred. A child who hates worksheets might tolerate math games or hands-on tools."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my child's math hatred my fault?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Math anxiety and hatred can develop from many sources: classroom experiences, comparison with peers, timed tests, or just a mismatch between learning style and teaching method. What matters now is how you respond going forward, not assigning blame for the past."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my child fail in life if they hate math?",
      "answer": "No. Many successful adults weren't math enthusiasts as children. What matters is developing basic numeracy and a functional relationship with math—not loving it. A child who can use math as a tool without anxiety is well-prepared for life."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to turn around math hatred?",
      "answer": "It varies widely. Some children shift within weeks once the approach changes; others need months. The key is consistency and patience. Focus on small wins and gradual progress rather than immediate transformation. Expect setbacks as part of the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the soroban help a child who hates math?",
      "answer": "The soroban (Japanese abacus) works because it's completely different from what's causing the hatred. It's physical, visual, and not associated with worksheets, tests, or school stress. For many children, this novelty creates an opportunity to experience math without their usual anxiety triggers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I tell my child I hated math too?",
      "answer": "Be careful with this. While commiserating might feel supportive, it can reinforce the idea that hating math is acceptable and permanent. Instead, if you struggled with math, share how your feelings changed or what eventually helped you—focus on growth, not shared negativity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child refuses to do any math at all?",
      "answer": "Complete refusal often signals deep anxiety or trauma around math. Consider talking to their teacher about reducing pressure, finding alternative formats (games, apps, physical tools), and possibly consulting with a school counselor. Sometimes a complete break followed by a fresh approach helps reset their relationship with math."
