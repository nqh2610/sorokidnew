    "intro": "'What do you already know about this?' seems like a simple question. But this simple question, asked systematically, transformed how I teach. The KWL strategy—Know, Want to Know, Learned—connects what students already understand to new learning, makes students active questioners rather than passive receivers, and builds reflection into every lesson. After fourteen years of using KWL across subjects and grade levels, I've seen struggling readers become engaged learners, passive students become curious investigators, and surface learning become deep understanding. Here's my complete guide to making KWL work in your classroom.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What grade levels is KWL appropriate for?",
      "answer": "KWL works from kindergarten through adult learners. For younger students (K-2), use simpler language ('What do you know? What do you wonder? What did you learn?'), more teacher support, and visual/verbal rather than written responses. Older students can use more sophisticated variations like KWHL."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a full KWL cycle take?",
      "answer": "K and W columns together typically take 10-20 minutes. The L column is completed after learning (could be minutes to weeks later). Don't rush; the value is in genuine thinking and discussion. For quick lessons, use a streamlined version; for units, revisit throughout."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if students' prior knowledge (K column) is wrong?",
      "answer": "That's valuable information! Record misconceptions without immediate correction. Address them through the learning experience. In the L column, explicitly note: 'We used to think X, but we learned Y.' This validates their original thinking while correcting it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I help students who say 'I don't know anything'?",
      "answer": "Rephrase: 'What have you heard about this?' 'What does this remind you of?' Use think-pair-share so they can hear others' ideas first. Accept tangential connections. Even 'I saw something about this on TV' counts as prior knowledge to build on."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should students fill in L immediately after learning?",
      "answer": "Ideally, yes—capture learning while fresh. However, you can also revisit the L column later to see what stuck long-term. Some teachers do immediate L, then revisit a week later to add or revise, building spaced retrieval practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if students' questions (W column) don't match my lesson plan?",
      "answer": "This is information! If many students wonder about something you weren't planning to address, consider adjusting. If questions are off-topic, acknowledge them: 'Great question—we won't answer that today, but maybe you can research it.' Honor curiosity even when redirecting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can KWL be used for fiction/narrative texts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! For fiction, K might be about the author, time period, genre, or similar books. W focuses on predictions and curiosities about the story. L captures what was discovered about characters, themes, or craft. Adapt the prompts to fit narrative purposes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is KWL different from anticipation guides or other pre-reading strategies?",
      "answer": "KWL is more open-ended than anticipation guides (which use predetermined statements). KWL generates student questions, creating ownership. It also explicitly connects prior knowledge to new learning and includes reflection. The three-column structure makes thinking progression visible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I grade KWL charts?",
      "answer": "KWL works best as formative assessment, not graded work. Grading can make students afraid to list misconceptions or ask 'stupid' questions. If you must assess, grade for completion and reflection quality, not for having the 'right' prior knowledge or questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I use KWL in my classroom?",
      "answer": "Use KWL whenever introducing a new topic where students have varied prior knowledge. It's particularly valuable for: beginning of units, before nonfiction reading, before investigations, when introducing new concepts. Daily use would be excessive, but regular use (weekly or per-unit) builds the habit."
