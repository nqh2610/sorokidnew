  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can sighing and frowning really damage my child's learning?",
      "answer": "Yes. Research shows children are highly attuned to parents' emotional states. Visible disappointment—even without yelling—creates anxiety. Anxiety releases cortisol, which impairs working memory needed for math. Your 'quiet' reactions may be causing real cognitive harm."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if I've already caused math anxiety in my child?",
      "answer": "Signs include: tensing up at homework time, saying 'I can't' before trying, crying easily during learning, hiding mistakes, saying they 'hate' learning, and performing worse with you than with others or alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the damage be undone?",
      "answer": "Yes, children are resilient. With consistent positive changes, most children recover. Expect a slow process—weeks to months of trust rebuilding. The younger the child and shorter the negative pattern, the faster the recovery."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I react when my child makes a mistake?",
      "answer": "Stay neutral or curious: 'Interesting! Let's look at this together.' 'What do you think happened here?' Avoid sighing, frowning, or any visible disappointment. Treat mistakes as normal parts of learning, not failures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I stop helping with homework altogether?",
      "answer": "If you can't control frustrated reactions, temporarily stepping back may help. Let apps or tutors handle instruction. Position yourself as cheerleader, not teacher. Some parent-child relationships work better without the teaching dynamic."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I stay patient when I'm genuinely frustrated?",
      "answer": "Take breaks when frustration rises—'Let's pause for 5 minutes.' Remember that your frustration makes their learning worse, not better. If breaks don't help, consider whether someone else (app, tutor, other parent) should handle instruction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it okay to have high expectations for my child?",
      "answer": "High expectations can be positive when they communicate 'I believe in your potential.' They become harmful when they communicate 'You must perform or face my disappointment.' The difference is whether your love feels conditional on performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child already hates math. How do I rebuild?",
      "answer": "First, apologize: 'I realize I made learning feel scary. I'm going to do better.' Then change your approach consistently. Celebrate effort, normalize mistakes, remove yourself from the teacher role. Expect months of gradual trust-rebuilding before attitudes shift."
    },
    {
      "question": "Won't my child become lazy if I'm not strict?",
      "answer": "Research shows the opposite. Children who feel safe making mistakes try harder and persist longer. Children who fear failure avoid challenges, give up quickly, and learn less. Safety enables learning; strictness often inhibits it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can apps help with this problem?",
      "answer": "Apps provide instruction without emotional investment. They don't sigh or frown. Mistakes are treated as normal game elements. This removes the parent-as-teacher dynamic that can create anxiety. You stay in the encouragement role while apps handle teaching."
