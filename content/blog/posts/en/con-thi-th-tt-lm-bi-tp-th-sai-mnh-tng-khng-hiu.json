    "intro": "My daughter came home with her math test: 92%. I was thrilled. That evening, I checked her homework before she turned it in: 4 out of 10 problems wrong—including some that were easier than what she'd aced on the test. I was baffled. How could someone perform so differently on essentially the same material? My first instinct was frustration: 'You can do this correctly when you want to—why are you being careless?' But after months of observing this pattern and researching what was really happening, I discovered the answer was far more complex and interesting than 'carelessness.' Understanding this gap transformed how I supported my daughter's learning.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why would a child do well on tests but poorly on homework?",
      "answer": "Several factors commonly cause this gap: attention depletion by evening, distracting home environments, lack of time pressure or urgency, lower perceived stakes, availability of help that reduces engagement, fatigue after a full school day, and different mental framing (performance vs. practice). Tests create conditions that support focus; homework often doesn't."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is 'carelessness' really the problem?",
      "answer": "Usually not. 'Carelessness' is typically a symptom of underlying conditions: distraction, fatigue, low motivation, or poor self-checking habits. Labeling errors as carelessness doesn't help because it doesn't identify what's actually causing the errors or what to do about it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best time of day for homework?",
      "answer": "Generally, earlier is better than later because attention capacity depletes throughout the day. Right after school (after a brief break and snack) often works better than after dinner. However, individual children vary—observe when your child seems most focused and try to schedule homework accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important is the homework environment?",
      "answer": "Extremely important. A quiet, dedicated space with minimal distractions can dramatically improve homework quality. Even minor distractions (visible phones, background TV, sibling activity) consume attention that should go to the work. Creating test-like environmental conditions supports test-like performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I help my child with homework?",
      "answer": "Strategic non-help is often more effective than immediate availability. When parents are always ready to help, children may engage less deeply with problems. Better approach: have children attempt work independently, mark uncertain items, then review together afterward. This builds independent problem-solving."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can time pressure improve homework quality?",
      "answer": "Unlimited time removes urgency, allowing attention to drift. Timed sessions (e.g., '20 minutes for math') create test-like pressure that focuses attention. The time constraint also prevents the task from expanding endlessly while productivity stays low."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could this pattern indicate ADHD or another condition?",
      "answer": "Possibly. Test conditions (high stakes, novel, structured) can mask attention difficulties that appear in unstructured homework settings. If environmental changes don't help, or if the pattern is extreme, professional evaluation may be appropriate. However, many children show this pattern without any underlying condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I build self-checking habits?",
      "answer": "Create a mandatory check routine before submission: reread each problem, verify calculations, check if answers make sense. Initially, you may need to require this explicitly; over time, it becomes automatic. Celebrating caught errors (rather than criticizing missed ones) reinforces the behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can apps like Sorokid help with homework focus?",
      "answer": "Gamified math apps can create test-like conditions (timed challenges, scores, immediate feedback) that activate focused thinking. Using such apps as a homework warm-up can help transition children into concentrated math mode before tackling assignments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see improvement after environmental changes?",
      "answer": "Many families see improvement within 2-3 weeks of consistent implementation. However, building new habits takes longer—expect 2-3 months for changes to become automatic. Consistency is key; sporadic implementation of new routines doesn't give them time to work."
