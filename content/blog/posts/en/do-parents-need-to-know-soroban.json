    "intro": "I remember the exact moment the panic hit me. My colleague had been raving about how her daughter learned mental math through something called 'Soroban'—a Japanese abacus. I went home, Googled it, and within ten minutes I was spiraling. YouTube videos showed tiny fingers flying across beads at impossible speeds. Teachers explained 'friends of 5' and 'complement pairs.' My brain completely shut down. How was I supposed to teach my daughter something I couldn't even understand? Eight months later, I still don't know how to use a Soroban. My daughter Lily can calculate 347 + 589 in her head. And honestly? My cluelessness might be the best thing that happened to her learning.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need to learn Soroban before my child starts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not. Modern Soroban apps like Sorokid are designed for children to learn independently. The app provides step-by-step instruction, immediate feedback, and adaptive difficulty. Your role is to support and encourage, not to teach the mechanics."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child asks me a Soroban question I can't answer?",
      "answer": "Say 'I don't know, let's figure it out together.' Replay the lesson, look at hints, or experiment together. Children learn problem-solving from watching adults approach challenges they don't immediately know how to solve."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my child progress slower if I can't help with the content?",
      "answer": "Research suggests the opposite. When children have to explain concepts to clueless parents (the protégé effect), they actually deepen their own understanding. Your role in providing consistency and encouragement matters more than content expertise."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I learn Soroban alongside my child?",
      "answer": "Only if you genuinely want to. Some parents enjoy learning together as a bonding activity. Others find they're more effective as cheerleaders than co-learners. Neither approach is wrong—choose what works for your family."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I help my child without understanding Soroban?",
      "answer": "Focus on: 1) Consistency—same practice time daily, 2) Encouragement—celebrate specific achievements, 3) Curiosity—ask them to explain what they learned, 4) Presence—sit nearby without hovering, 5) Real-world connections—create mental math moments in daily life."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the most important thing a parent can do for Soroban learning?",
      "answer": "Consistency beats content knowledge every time. A child who practices 15 minutes daily with a clueless-but-supportive parent will outperform a child who practices sporadically with an expert parent. Protect the practice time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my child is making progress if I don't understand the content?",
      "answer": "Learn to read the metrics. Understand what levels mean, track accuracy percentages, notice calculation speed improvements, and watch for increased confidence. You don't need to understand HOW they're doing it to see THAT they're improving."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child seems frustrated and I can't help. What do I do?",
      "answer": "Frustration often needs emotional support, not technical help. Try: 'This seems hard. Want to take a break?' or 'Let's do some easier ones first.' Sometimes just acknowledging the difficulty helps. If it persists, the app likely has hint features or easier practice modes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it bad that my child knows more than me about Soroban?",
      "answer": "It's actually wonderful! Being the expert builds confidence and ownership of learning. Ask your child to teach you—it reinforces their knowledge and makes them feel capable. Model that adults don't know everything and that's perfectly okay."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take before I see results in my child's math ability?",
      "answer": "Most parents notice improved mental calculation speed within 4-6 weeks of consistent daily practice. School math grades typically improve within one semester. Remember, consistency is key—15 minutes daily beats an hour once a week."
