    "intro": "As an elementary school principal, I've observed countless children struggle with place value - the concept that a digit's position determines its value. When I introduced soroban to my own two children, I witnessed something remarkable: place value stopped being abstract. On the soroban, each column IS a place value, physically separated and visually distinct. This article will show you how the soroban represents multi-digit numbers and why it's such a powerful tool for building number sense.",

    }
  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does the soroban represent place value?",
      "answer": "Each column on the soroban represents one place value position. The rightmost column is ones, next is tens, then hundreds, thousands, and so on. Each column can show 0-9 using the same bead rules (heaven bead = 5, earth beads = 1 each). This physical separation makes place value visible and tangible."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I read multi-digit numbers on the soroban?",
      "answer": "Read from left to right, just like written numbers. Read each column's value based on its position: the leftmost non-zero column gives the largest place value, and you combine all columns. For example, if the thousands column shows 3, hundreds shows 4, tens shows 0, and ones shows 7, the number is 3,407."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I set a multi-digit number on the soroban?",
      "answer": "Work from left to right (largest to smallest place value). First clear the soroban, then set each digit in its proper column starting from the leftmost digit. For 2,534: set 2 in thousands, 5 in hundreds, 3 in tens, 4 in ones. Verify by reading back."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I represent zero in the middle of a number on soroban?",
      "answer": "Zero is represented by an empty column - all beads away from the beam (earth beads down, heaven bead up). For 305, the tens column would be empty while hundreds shows 3 and ones shows 5. The visible empty column helps children understand placeholder zeros."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do the marked rods on a soroban indicate?",
      "answer": "Marked rods (dots, different colored beads, or wider gaps) typically appear every third column, indicating ones, thousands, and millions positions. These marks help when working with large numbers, making it easier to identify columns and read values like 1,234,567 without counting columns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the soroban good for teaching place value?",
      "answer": "The soroban makes place value physical and visible. Each column IS a place value, physically separated and distinct. Children can see that 305 has an empty tens column while 350 does not. This tangible representation helps build genuine number sense that transfers to written math."
    },
    {
      "question": "At what age should children learn multi-digit numbers on soroban?",
      "answer": "After children master single-digit representation (0-9), typically around age 5-7, they can begin learning two-digit numbers. Progress to three and four digits as each level becomes comfortable. Most children can work with four-digit numbers within 2-3 months of starting multi-digit practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are common mistakes when learning multi-digit soroban representation?",
      "answer": "Common mistakes include: skipping zero columns when reading (reading 305 as 35), confusing column positions, setting numbers right-to-left instead of left-to-right, and not clearing the soroban before setting new numbers. The Sorokid app provides immediate feedback to catch and correct these errors."
    },
    {
      "question": "How large can numbers get on a soroban?",
      "answer": "Standard sorobans have 13-23 columns, allowing numbers up to trillions (13 columns) or more. Each additional column adds another place value. For children's learning, 4-6 digit numbers are typically sufficient and match elementary school curriculum."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I practice multi-digit number recognition with my child?",
      "answer": "Start with two-digit numbers until comfortable, then progress to three and four digits. Mix numbers with zeros to reinforce placeholder concept. Use real-world examples ('show me your age,' 'show me our house number'). The Sorokid app includes progressive number recognition exercises with instant feedback."
