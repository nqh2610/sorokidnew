  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can a 10-year-old still benefit from Soroban?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. A 10-year-old will learn differently—faster conceptual understanding but potentially less 'automatic' than someone who started younger. They can still develop solid mental math skills and improved number sense. They may not reach competition levels, but that's rarely the actual goal anyway."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is age 4 too young to start?",
      "answer": "It depends on the child and the approach. A play-based, zero-pressure introduction can work well for interested 4-year-olds. Formal instruction with expectations usually doesn't work at this age. If your 4-year-old shows interest, explore gently. If not, wait—there's no rush."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is 8 and already struggles with math. Is it too late?",
      "answer": "Actually, Soroban can be especially helpful for kids who struggle with traditional math. The visual, tactile approach gives them a different way to understand numbers. Starting at 8 with existing struggles isn't 'late'—it's potentially perfect timing to change their relationship with math."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do kids who start earlier always end up better?",
      "answer": "No. Early starters have more time, but that only matters if they use it well. I've seen kids who started at 4, got burned out at 6, and quit. Meanwhile, kids who started at 8 with genuine interest surpassed them. Starting age is just one factor among many."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I wait until my child asks about Soroban?",
      "answer": "Most kids won't spontaneously ask for math training. It's fine to introduce it and see if interest develops. The key is watching their response—if they engage, continue. If they resist, don't force it. You can always try again in 6-12 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child is 12? Is there any point?",
      "answer": "There's still benefit, though expectations should be realistic. A 12-year-old can develop solid mental math skills and number sense. The main challenge is competing priorities (school, activities, social life) and possible embarrassment about 'basic' work. If they're interested, it's worth trying."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can adults learn Soroban?",
      "answer": "Yes! Adults learn Soroban for brain training, dementia prevention, and mental calculation skills. Progress is slower than children, and competition-level ability is unlikely, but meaningful improvement in mental math is absolutely achievable at any age."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my child is 'ready' for Soroban?",
      "answer": "Signs of readiness: can count to 10 reliably, can sit and focus for at least 5-10 minutes, shows some interest in games or puzzles, doesn't have severe math anxiety. The best test is simply trying a few lessons—their response will tell you if it's the right time."
