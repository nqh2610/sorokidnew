    "intro": "'Look at the paper!' 'Stop fidgeting!' 'FOCUS!' These were the words I said to my seven-year-old son Noah every single day during math homework. He'd stare at the ceiling, play with his pencil, slide off his chair, ask for water, need the bathroom, suddenly remember something urgent to tell me—anything but look at the math problems in front of him. After three months of daily battles, I was convinced something was seriously wrong. Was it ADHD? A learning disability? Or was my child just... difficult? What I discovered surprised me, and the solution we found changed everything about how I understood my son's brain.",

The rest of the time he'd been making his pencil 'walk' across the table, humming, kicking his chair legs, and asking if he could have a snack. When I raised my voice in frustration, he burst into tears. 'I'm trying!' he sobbed. 'My brain won't work!' That moment broke my heart—because I suddenly realized: he wasn't being defiant. He genuinely couldn't make himself focus."

        "question": "How do I get my child evaluated for ADHD?",
        "answer": "Start with your pediatrician, who can do initial screening and refer to a psychologist, psychiatrist, or developmental pediatrician. Schools can also conduct evaluations for educational purposes, though these focus on academic impact rather than medical diagnosis."
      },
      {
        "question": "If it is ADHD, does that mean medication?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily. Treatment options include behavioral strategies, environmental modifications, therapy, educational accommodations, and yes, medication. Many families use a combination. Medication is one tool, not the only option or automatic first step."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can kids with ADHD succeed at math?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Many successful mathematicians, scientists, and entrepreneurs have ADHD. The key is finding strategies that work with their brain—often involving movement, novelty, and shorter focused bursts. ADHD brains can achieve remarkable things with the right approach."

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long should a child be able to focus on math?",
      "answer": "It varies by age: 4-5 year olds typically focus for 4-10 minutes, 6-7 year olds for 12-15 minutes, 8-9 year olds for 16-20 minutes, and 10-12 year olds for 20-30 minutes. If your expectations exceed these norms, the problem may be your expectations, not your child's attention."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my child's inability to focus on math a sign of ADHD?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. True ADHD shows focus problems across ALL activities and settings, not just math. If your child can focus on things they enjoy (games, TV, building) but not math, the issue is more likely situational—related to timing, interest, difficulty level, or learning style."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can my child focus on video games but not math?",
      "answer": "Video games are designed to capture attention with constant novelty, immediate feedback, and rewards. Math worksheets offer none of these. This isn't a character flaw—it's how brains work. Finding math formats that are more engaging (games, hands-on tools) can help bridge this gap."
    },
    {
      "question": "What time of day is best for math practice?",
      "answer": "Every child is different, but many struggle right after school when their brain is depleted. Try experimenting with morning before school, after a snack and rest period, or after dinner. Watch when your child seems most alert and receptive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I let my fidgety child move during math?",
      "answer": "Often, yes! Some children focus better with movement, not worse. Try a wobble cushion, standing desk, stress ball, or tools like the soroban that require physical manipulation. Channel the fidget energy into something purposeful rather than fighting it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the soroban help my child focus?",
      "answer": "The soroban (Japanese abacus) gives fidgety hands something meaningful to do. The physical manipulation of beads IS the math—every movement counts. For kinesthetic learners and children who struggle with sitting still for worksheets, this physical engagement can dramatically improve focus and retention."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I have my child evaluated for ADHD?",
      "answer": "Consider evaluation if: focus problems persist across multiple subjects and settings, strategies don't help after 2-3 months, teachers express concern, problems impact daily life beyond academics, or your parental instinct says something is genuinely off. Start with your pediatrician."
    },
    {
      "question": "If my child has ADHD, does that mean medication?",
      "answer": "Not automatically. ADHD treatment includes behavioral strategies, environmental modifications, therapy, and educational accommodations—not just medication. Many families use multiple approaches. Medication is one effective tool but always a personal family decision made with professional guidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I make math more engaging for my distracted child?",
      "answer": "Try: shorter sessions (10-15 minutes), gamified apps instead of worksheets, hands-on manipulatives like the soroban, real-world math (cooking, shopping, sports stats), movement breaks between problems, and connecting math to their interests. The goal is finding what captures their specific brain."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can children with focus problems succeed at math?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Many highly successful people had attention challenges as children. The key is finding approaches that work with their brain—often involving movement, novelty, shorter bursts of focus, and hands-on learning. Focus challenges aren't intelligence limitations; they're learning style differences."
