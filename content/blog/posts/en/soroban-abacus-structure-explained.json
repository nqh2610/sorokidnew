    "intro": "As an architect, I appreciate elegant design. When I first held a soroban – the Japanese abacus my daughter brought home from her after-school program – I was immediately struck by its beautiful simplicity. What looks like just beads on rods is actually a masterpiece of mathematical engineering, refined over centuries for speed and efficiency. Before my three kids started learning soroban calculations, I spent time understanding the tool itself. That knowledge made me a better teacher and helped my children progress faster. In this guide, I'll share everything I learned about soroban structure, from the obvious parts to the subtle design choices that make this tool so effective.",

      {
        "question": "Do I need to buy an expensive soroban?",
        "answer": "No. A basic $10-15 plastic soroban works perfectly for learning. Premium wooden models ($30-100+) feel nicer but won't help your child learn faster. Start affordable and upgrade later if interest persists."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the dot on some rods for?",
        "answer": "Those are unit rod markers. They help locate the ones place quickly, especially in large numbers. Usually marked every third rod, they serve as reference points for place value."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are some beads different colors?",
        "answer": "Learning sorobans often use colors to help beginners distinguish heaven beads from earth beads. Traditional sorobans are single-colored. Either works for learning – color-coded can be helpful initially."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What are the main parts of a soroban abacus?",
      "answer": "The soroban has seven essential parts: the frame (outer border), rods (vertical columns), beam (horizontal divider), heaven beads (one per rod above beam, worth 5), earth beads (four per rod below beam, worth 1 each), unit rod markers (dots for place value), and sometimes a clearing mechanism."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many beads does a soroban have per column?",
      "answer": "Each column (rod) has exactly 5 beads: 1 heaven bead above the beam worth 5, and 4 earth beads below the beam each worth 1. This allows any digit from 0-9 to be represented on a single rod."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a soroban and a Chinese abacus?",
      "answer": "The Japanese soroban has 1 heaven bead and 4 earth beads per rod (5 total), while the Chinese abacus (suanpan) has 2 heaven beads and 5 earth beads (7 total). The soroban's streamlined design allows for faster calculations in base-10 mathematics."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the beam on a soroban?",
      "answer": "The beam (also called reckoning bar) is the horizontal divider that separates heaven beads from earth beads. Beads touching the beam are 'counted' while beads away from the beam represent zero. It's the critical reference point for all calculations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I buy a physical soroban or use a virtual app?",
      "answer": "Both have advantages. Physical sorobans provide tactile feedback and no screen time. Virtual sorobans (like Sorokid) offer progress tracking, interactive lessons, and are always available. Many families start physical, then use apps for daily practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "What size soroban is best for children?",
      "answer": "For ages 4-6, a 13-rod lightweight plastic soroban is ideal. For ages 7-10, a 13-17 rod standard model works well. Children don't need more rods than necessary – extra columns can be distracting for beginners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are soroban beads diamond-shaped?",
      "answer": "The bicone (diamond) shape is intentional. The pointed edges allow precise finger contact for faster manipulation, flat surfaces provide stability at rest, and sharp edges help fingers distinguish individual beads by touch."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I clear a soroban before calculations?",
      "answer": "To clear (reset to zero): push all heaven beads UP away from the beam, and all earth beads DOWN away from the beam. A quick method is to tilt the soroban toward you, letting gravity pull earth beads down, then manually push heaven beads up."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do the numbers 0-9 look like on a soroban?",
      "answer": "0: all beads away from beam. 1-4: only earth beads at beam. 5: only heaven bead at beam. 6-9: heaven bead plus 1-4 earth beads at beam. For example, 7 = heaven bead (5) + 2 earth beads (2) = 7."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I position a soroban for practice?",
      "answer": "Place the soroban flat on a desk or tilted slightly (5-10 degrees) toward you, about forearm's length away. Elbows should be relaxed when reaching the beads. Use a non-slip surface or mat to prevent the soroban from sliding during practice."
