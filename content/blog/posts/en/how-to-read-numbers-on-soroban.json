    "intro": "When my 7-year-old started soroban, I felt completely useless. He'd show me his homework, beads in some mysterious configuration, and I'd smile and nod—having no clue if it was right. 'That's great, buddy!' I'd say, secretly hoping he hadn't just shown me the mathematical equivalent of gibberish. After months of feeling helpless, I decided to learn the system properly. Turns out, reading a soroban is far simpler than it looks—and once you understand it, you can actually HELP your child. This guide is everything I wish someone had explained to me on day one.",
