Some were disasters (one literally made my 8-year-old cry). Some were surprisingly good. Here's what I learned—including the questions most parents forget to ask before downloading anything.",

That's when I realized: most 'best of' lists are either outdated, sponsored, or written by people who never actually used the apps with real kids."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "My advice: Take advantage of free trials. Test with YOUR kid for at least two weeks before committing. Watch them use it—don't just check completion badges.

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is the best free math app for kids?",
      "answer": "Khan Academy Kids is the best completely free option for ages 2-8. For older kids, Prodigy's free version offers good gamified practice, though it has upselling. Most quality apps offer free trials—take advantage of these before subscribing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are paid math apps worth the money?",
      "answer": "It depends on what you're paying for. Subscription apps like Sorokid or IXL can be worth it if your child actually uses them consistently—often cheaper than tutoring. One-time purchase apps like DragonBox are good value for concept introduction. Avoid apps where you're mainly paying to remove ads or unlock cosmetic items."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should my child use a math app each day?",
      "answer": "10-15 minutes of focused practice is more effective than longer unfocused sessions. Most good apps are designed for short daily practice. Consistency matters more than duration—10 minutes every day beats 1 hour once a week."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child gets bored with math apps quickly. What should I do?",
      "answer": "This is common! Try apps with clear progression and rewards (like Sorokid or Prodigy) to maintain motivation. Also consider whether the app is too easy (boring) or too hard (frustrating). Rotate between 2-3 apps if needed, but give each at least 2 weeks before giving up."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can math apps replace tutoring?",
      "answer": "For building fluency and practice, quality apps can definitely replace expensive tutoring. For diagnosing specific learning difficulties or providing personalized human feedback, a tutor may still be valuable. Many families use apps for daily practice and tutors for occasional check-ins."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Prodigy and Sorokid?",
      "answer": "Prodigy is a full RPG game where math problems unlock game progress—great for motivation but the game can overshadow learning. Sorokid focuses specifically on building mental math skills through a visual method, with game elements supporting (not replacing) the learning. Prodigy covers broader curriculum; Sorokid goes deeper on mental calculation."
