Or is 4 too young, and pushing her will backfire? I spent 2 months researching – from scientific studies to asking parents who started their kids early. Here's what I learned.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best age to start Soroban?",
      "answer": "There's no 'best age' for everyone. Most common is 5-6 years old. Some kids are ready at 4. What matters is that your child is READY, not how OLD they are."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should a 4-year-old practice each day?",
      "answer": "5-10 minutes/day is enough. Can split into 2 sessions (5 min morning, 5 min evening). Don't exceed 15 min/session – 4-year-olds have limited attention spans."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can my child learn Soroban if they don't know letters yet?",
      "answer": "Yes. Soroban uses NUMBERS, not letters. Just need to recognize numbers 0-9. Sorokid App has images and sounds that help children who can't read yet still learn."
    },
    {
      "question": "My 4-year-old gets bored easily, doesn't focus – should they learn?",
      "answer": "If your child can't sit still for 5 minutes for ANY activity, they may not be ready. Try building focus first with games: puzzles, drawing, reading books. After 2-3 months, try again."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use a real abacus or an app for 4-year-olds?",
      "answer": "COMBINE both. Physical abacus helps with tactile sensation and fine motor development. App (like Sorokid) has attractive images and sounds, suitable for young children."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child has been learning for 1 month with no progress – why?",
      "answer": "Could be: (1) Child not ready – wait, (2) Session too short/long, (3) Method not suitable – try different approach. Observe: Is your child HAPPY? If they're stressed, stop."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do boys and girls learn Soroban differently at age 4?",
      "answer": "No difference in ability. Girls may develop fine motor skills slightly earlier (helpful for moving beads), but the difference isn't significant."
    },
    {
      "question": "I don't know Soroban – can I teach my child myself?",
      "answer": "Yes. For 4-year-olds, just teach numbers 1-9 and simple addition/subtraction. Sorokid App has step-by-step guidance. Later when your child advances, consider specialized classes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does early Soroban learning have any negative effects?",
      "answer": "No, IF done correctly: short sessions, fun, no pressure. Negative effects only happen when: forcing too much practice, scolding when child makes mistakes, creating achievement pressure. The problem isn't Soroban, it's HOW you teach."
