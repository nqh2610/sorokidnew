      "question": "Why is random group assignment better than student self-selection?",

Random assignment ensures fairness, mixes social groups, distributes skills, and teaches students to collaborate with anyone."

      "question": "How much time does random group formation save?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What group sizes work best for different activities?",
      "answer": "Pairs (2) for quick discussions where everyone must participate. Triads (3) for problem-solving with discussion and recording roles. Quads (4) for projects balancing contribution and accountability. Groups of 5-6 for debates or presentations needing diverse perspectives."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I exclude certain students from being grouped together?",
      "answer": "Many random group tools allow constraints or manual adjustments. For serious conflicts, override results discreetly. However, for minor preferences, letting randomness work often produces positive outcomes as students discover they can collaborate with anyone."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I introduce random grouping to my class?",
      "answer": "Set clear expectations: groups will be random with no exceptions. Explain the fairness logic—everyone gets different partners over time. Have designated areas for each group number so movement is immediate. Establish that complaining wastes everyone's time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I have an odd number of students?",
