      "answer": "UCMAS: $100-200/month + materials + exam fees = about $2,400-4,800 for 2 years. Soroban online: $10-15/month = $240-360 for 2 years. Difference of 5-10x."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are learning outcomes different?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What's the value of UCMAS certificates?",
      "answer": "Recognized in 80+ countries. Can add to college applications, scholarship portfolios. But if you only need mental math skills, certificates aren't required."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is already at UCMAS. Should we switch to online?",
      "answer": "If your child is progressing well at UCMAS, no need to switch. If facing difficulties (cost, time), you can switch to online to maintain skills."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Soroban online suitable for hyperactive kids?",
      "answer": "May be harder without in-person teachers maintaining discipline. But apps have gamification (games, points) that can hold attention. Try and see how your child responds."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until we see results?",
      "answer": "UCMAS: 2-3 months for simple mental math, 1-2 years for mastery. Soroban online: similar timeline but may be slower if child isn't self-motivated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we do both?",
      "answer": "Possible but not recommended. Same method, learning in 2 places is redundant. Choose 1 and learn until mastery."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is Sorokid different from UCMAS?",
      "answer": "Sorokid is an APP for learning Soroban online. Different from UCMAS: learn at home (no center trips), cost 5-10x lower, no international certificates, flexible schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I choose wrong?",
