    "intro": "'Honey, learning stuff is your department. I'm too tired.' My husband Mike said this for years. He leaves for work at 7 AM, comes home at 8 or 9 PM, exhausted. Sitting through a homework session? Impossible. I understood he was tired. But I was tired too. And I wanted him INVOLVED—not necessarily tutoring for 2 hours, just present in some meaningful way. Eventually, we figured it out. It takes Mike just 5 minutes a day. But the impact on our kids has been bigger than I expected.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How can a busy dad help with children's education?",
      "answer": "Busy dads can help with just 5 minutes daily: ask about what child learned, review app progress on weekends, play mental math games during car rides, or do a nightly 'Show Me' ritual where kids demonstrate one thing they learned. Consistency and genuine interest matter more than time spent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does father involvement matter for children's learning?",
      "answer": "Research shows children with involved fathers perform 20-30% better academically. When children see both parents engaged in their education, they internalize that learning is a family value. This is especially important for sons who look to fathers as role models."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can fathers do if they don't understand the schoolwork?",
      "answer": "Fathers don't need to understand content to be involved. They can show interest by asking questions, witnessing progress, reviewing completed work, and celebrating effort. 'Teach me what you learned' positions the child as expert—which actually reinforces their learning."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time does a parent need to make a difference in education?",
      "answer": "Quality beats quantity. A focused, engaged 5 minutes daily is more valuable than 60 distracted minutes. The key is consistency (daily touch points) and genuine interest (specific questions about what they're learning)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are quick ways for working parents to stay involved in learning?",
      "answer": "Quick involvement strategies include: asking 'What do you want to learn today?' at breakfast, reviewing digital progress reports, playing mental math games in the car, doing a 3-minute 'Show Me' before bed, and making one specific comment about their work weekly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do learning apps help busy parents stay connected?",
      "answer": "Learning apps with progress tracking let busy parents see completed sessions, improved skills, and struggle areas—without sitting through practice. This provides specific talking points: 'I saw you did the carrying exercise 3 times' is better than 'How was math?'"
    },
    {
      "question": "What should moms do if dads are too busy to help with homework?",
      "answer": "Don't ask him to do what you do—suggest 5 minutes of something different. Recommend specific activities rather than vague 'help more.' Let him develop his own style. Use apps so he can track progress remotely. Celebrate his involvement publicly to kids."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get my husband more involved in our child's education?",
      "answer": "Start small: suggest one 5-minute activity that doesn't require teaching knowledge. The 'Show Me' ritual (child demonstrates one thing learned) works well. Use progress tracking apps so he can see specific improvements. Make involvement easy and enjoyable, not an obligation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does father involvement affect boys and girls differently?",
      "answer": "Father involvement benefits both genders, but is especially important for boys. Sons look to fathers as role models for what's important. If dad is 'invisible' regarding education, boys may unconsciously conclude that learning isn't important for men."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if a child doesn't want to show their work to dad?",
      "answer": "Give choices: 'Show Dad something from school, from your app, or something you read—your pick.' Options increase buy-in. Also ensure dad's reactions are genuinely enthusiastic, not critical. Kids participate when they anticipate positive responses."
