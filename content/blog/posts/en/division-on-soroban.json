    "intro": "Division intimidated me when I first learned soroban alongside my children. As a former accountant, I was comfortable with numbers, but soroban division seemed impossibly complex. Then something clicked: division on the soroban is just answering one question repeatedly – 'How many times does this fit?' Once I understood this, I could teach my three kids the same insight. In this guide, I'll share exactly how we learned soroban division, including the prerequisites, step-by-step methods, and the breakthrough moments that made it all make sense.",

    {
      "question": "What is soroban division?",
      "answer": "Soroban division is a method of dividing numbers using the Japanese abacus. It involves repeatedly asking 'how many times does the divisor fit into this portion of the dividend,' tracking the count, subtracting, and repeating until completion."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should my child start learning soroban division?",
      "answer": "Children should start soroban division after 4-6 months of practice minimum, when multiplication is comfortable, times tables (1-9) are solid, and the child shows confidence. Most children are ready between ages 8-10."
    },
    {
      "question": "What prerequisites are needed for soroban division?",
      "answer": "Prerequisites include: automatic addition/subtraction with carrying, comfortable multiplication (at least single-digit), solid times tables through 9, strong place value understanding, and good estimation skills."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does soroban handle division remainders?",
      "answer": "On the soroban, remainders are visible! After subtracting as many complete groups of the divisor as possible, the remaining beads show the remainder. This visual confirmation helps children understand what remainders represent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is soroban division considered the most advanced basic operation?",
      "answer": "Division combines estimation, multiplication, subtraction, and place value understanding into one complex process. It requires all previous skills working together, making it the most demanding of the four basic operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can soroban division help with school long division?",
      "answer": "Yes! Soroban division uses identical concepts to long division: estimation, place value tracking, and subtraction of partial products. Children who learn soroban division often find school long division easier."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until my child can do mental division?",
      "answer": "Mental division typically develops 6-12 months after starting soroban division. Children eventually visualize the beads moving in their minds, tracking quotient digits and watching the dividend shrink."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are common mistakes in soroban division?",
      "answer": "Common mistakes include estimation errors (guessing too high or low), forgetting to subtract after finding quotient digits, place value confusion, and giving up without combining digits. Strong times tables help prevent most errors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I teach division if my child struggles with multiplication?",
      "answer": "No. Division requires solid multiplication skills because you need to quickly estimate 'how many times does the divisor fit.' Strengthen multiplication and times tables before attempting division."
    },
