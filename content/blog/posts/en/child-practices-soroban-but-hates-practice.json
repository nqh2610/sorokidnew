    {
      "question": "Is skipping one day a problem?",
      "answer": "Not really. But don't let it become consecutive days off. One day rest after 6 days of practice is fine."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many minutes should kids practice Soroban daily?",
      "answer": "10-15 minutes is enough for elementary kids. Quality matters more than quantity. Short consistent sessions beat long infrequent ones."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I build a daily Soroban habit?",
      "answer": "Attach it to a fixed activity: after dinner, after bath, after nap. Repeat daily until it becomes automatic – usually takes 2-3 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is bored of Soroban. Should I change methods?",
      "answer": "First try switching approaches: use app instead of worksheets, shorten time, add rewards. If still bored, take a 1-2 week break and try again."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the app better than paper worksheets?",
      "answer": "Depends on the child. Many kids prefer apps because of points and games. Some learn better with physical abacus. Try both to see what works."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I pay my child to practice?",
      "answer": "Generally not per session – it creates transactional expectations and can backfire. A weekly allowance tied to responsibilities (including practice) is okay."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child argues no matter what. Help!",
      "answer": "Stop arguing back. State the expectation, walk away. \"Soroban before screens. Let me know when you're done.\" Don't engage in debate. Consistency is key."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if 10 minutes feels too short?",
      "answer": "10 minutes is the minimum to get started without resistance. Most kids continue beyond 10 once they start. Consistency (10 min daily) beats volume (long sessions occasionally)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my child is genuinely tired vs being lazy?",
      "answer": "Look at behavior patterns. Genuinely tired: after school tests, illness, late nights. Being lazy: only tired for Soroban but energetic for games/TV. Address accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will the practice battle end?",
      "answer": "Usually after 2-3 weeks of consistent routine. Once habit is formed, the brain automates it like brushing teeth. The first few weeks are the hardest – push through."
