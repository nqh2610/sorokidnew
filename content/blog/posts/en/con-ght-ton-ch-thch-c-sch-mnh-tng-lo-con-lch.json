But put a math worksheet in front of her and everything changes: sighing, complaining, 'This is too hard,' 'This is so boring.' I spent years worrying she was 'imbalanced'—gifted in language, deficient in math. What I eventually learned changed everything: she wasn't bad at math. She was learning the wrong way for her brain.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is it normal for children who love reading to dislike math?",
      "answer": "Yes, it's very common. Reading-lovers often struggle with how math is presented—abstract, decontextualized, non-narrative. This isn't a deficiency; it's a learning style mismatch. Story-based math presentation often solves the problem completely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I restrict reading time to force more math practice?",
      "answer": "No—this typically backfires. Restricting reading creates resentment toward math ('I can't read because of stupid math'). Instead, use their reading interest to make math more engaging. Find math in their favorite books. Let them write stories involving math."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my child 'imbalanced' if they prefer reading to math?",
      "answer": "The 'imbalance' framing is misleading. Having strengths isn't a problem. Reading skills actually support mathematical thinking—pattern recognition, sequential reasoning, attention to detail. The goal isn't equal passion; it's removing barriers so natural intelligence applies to math."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I make math more appealing to a bookworm?",
      "answer": "Present math through stories and contexts they care about. Convert abstract problems into narratives with characters. Find math in books they already love. Let them write about math concepts. Allow verbal processing—talking through problems. Use their verbal strengths rather than fighting against them."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my reading-focused child struggle in math throughout school?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Many literary-minded children excel at word problems once they engage with math. The skills used for reading—logical deduction, pattern recognition, sequential thinking—transfer to mathematics. The barrier is usually presentation, not ability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I be worried if my child says 'I'm not a math person'?",
      "answer": "Yes—this fixed mindset belief limits performance. Challenge it directly: 'Math people aren't born; they're developed. You haven't found your math approach yet.' Share examples of writers and artists who used math. Emphasize that struggle means learning is happening, not that ability is lacking."
    },
    {
      "question": "What books combine stories and math for reluctant math learners?",
      "answer": "Look for 'math adventure' books like Bedtime Math, The Number Devil, Murderous Maths series, and Sir Cumference books. Also use any book they love and create math problems within its world—Harry Potter economics, Percy Jackson quest calculations, etc."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to change a child's attitude toward math?",
      "answer": "Attitude changes happen gradually over months, not days. You may see reduced resistance within weeks of changing presentation, but genuine confidence takes longer. Consistency is key—maintain the story-based, low-pressure approach even when progress seems slow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I hire a math tutor for my reading-focused child?",
      "answer": "A tutor can help, but only if they understand verbal learners. A tutor who just does more worksheets will likely fail. Look for tutors who use stories, word problems, and verbal explanation. Interview them specifically about their approach to literary-minded students."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it okay if my child just 'tolerates' math rather than loves it?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Not every child will love math, just as not every child loves reading. The goal is competence without anxiety. If your child can do math confidently and sees it as a useful skill rather than a dreaded enemy, you've succeeded—regardless of whether they'd choose math for fun."
