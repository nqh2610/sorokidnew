When I had a daughter, I found myself almost unconsciously directing her toward books rather than puzzles. Then one day, my 5-year-old said, 'Math is for boys.' I was horrified—where had she learned that? And was it true? What I discovered through months of research changed how I parent and how I view the myth entirely.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Are boys and girls really equal in math ability?",
      "answer": "Yes. Decades of cognitive research show no significant innate difference in mathematical ability between male and female brains. Where gaps exist, they correlate with cultural factors like stereotypes, expectations, and opportunity—not biological differences."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do people believe boys are better at math?",
      "answer": "This belief persists because of stereotype threat (girls underperform when reminded of the stereotype), different treatment (boys receive more math encouragement), and self-selection (girls who believe the stereotype avoid math). The belief creates its own evidence—but the underlying ability is equal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is stereotype threat and how does it affect math performance?",
      "answer": "Stereotype threat occurs when awareness of a negative stereotype (like 'girls are bad at math') creates anxiety that impairs performance. When girls are reminded of this stereotype before tests, scores drop. Without the reminder, girls perform equally to boys. The threat, not the ability, causes the difference."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do parents accidentally reinforce math gender stereotypes?",
      "answer": "Parents often attribute boys' math success to ability and girls' success to hard work; spend more time explaining math to boys; express more surprise when girls succeed; and assume girls' struggles indicate inability rather than normal learning challenges. These subtle differences communicate different expectations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I say when my daughter says 'math is for boys'?",
      "answer": "Address it directly: 'That's something people used to believe, but scientists have proven it's not true. Girls and boys are equally good at math. There are amazing women mathematicians and scientists.' Then provide examples and continue supporting her math confidence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I help my daughter build math confidence?",
      "answer": "Eliminate gender language about math, attribute success to both ability and effort, provide female math role models, normalize struggle as part of learning, challenge stereotypes directly when they appear, and never express surprise at her math achievements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do boys and girls have different learning styles for math?",
      "answer": "Some research suggests small average differences in spatial or verbal processing, but these are tiny compared to individual variation, may be products of experience rather than biology, and don't predict math success. Good teaching adapts to individuals, not gender categories."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do math gaps appear in older grades if they don't exist in early childhood?",
      "answer": "Early childhood shows equal performance. Gaps emerge later because accumulated stereotype exposure, different treatment, and self-selection take time to create effects. By middle school, years of subtle messages have shaped beliefs, confidence, and choices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there countries where the math gender gap doesn't exist?",
      "answer": "Yes. In countries with greater gender equality (parts of Scandinavia, some East Asian nations), the math gap virtually disappears or even reverses. This strongly suggests the gap is cultural, not biological—if it were innate, it would appear universally."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can schools do to reduce math gender bias?",
      "answer": "Schools can train teachers in implicit bias, ensure equal attention and encouragement, provide diverse role models, avoid ability grouping that may inadvertently track by gender, use growth mindset language, and create environments where struggle is normalized for everyone."
