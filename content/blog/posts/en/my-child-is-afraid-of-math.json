    "intro": "The night my 8-year-old Emma locked herself in the bathroom to avoid math homework, I finally accepted we had a real problem. This wasn't laziness. This wasn't 'not trying hard enough.' My daughter—bright, curious, loved reading—was genuinely terrified of numbers. What followed was a six-month journey that taught me everything schools don't tell you about math anxiety in children. If your child freezes up, melts down, or says 'I hate math' with real pain in their voice, this is for you.",

This is the honest guide I wish someone had handed me that night outside the bathroom door."

    {
      "question": "How long does it take to overcome math anxiety?",
      "answer": "There's no fixed timeline—every child is different. For us, it took about 6 months to see significant improvement, with the first 2-3 months feeling like we weren't making progress at all. Small wins often happen before big breakthroughs become visible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I let my child skip math homework if they're too anxious?",
      "answer": "Occasionally, yes—forcing a panicking child through homework does more harm than good. But avoidance can't become the permanent solution. Work with the teacher on accommodations while building skills and confidence separately from homework."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is math anxiety a sign of a learning disability?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily, but sometimes they overlap. If anxiety persists despite your best efforts, consider an evaluation for dyscalculia (a math-specific learning difference) or other processing issues. Many kids have both anxiety AND an underlying challenge that feeds the anxiety."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child does fine in class but melts down at home. Why?",
      "answer": "This is actually very common. School requires 'holding it together,' and home is the safe space where those big feelings finally come out. It's not that you're doing something wrong—it's that your child feels safe enough with you to fall apart."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my child always struggle with math?",
      "answer": "No. Math ability is not fixed at birth. With the right support, adjusted approach, and time, most children can become competent and even confident in math. The anxiety is a separate issue from actual mathematical ability—address the fear, and the skills often follow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I tell the teacher about my child's math anxiety?",
      "answer": "Absolutely yes. Teachers can make accommodations like extra time, untimed tests, avoiding public call-outs, and providing additional support. Most teachers want to help but can't if they don't know what's happening."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it okay to say I was bad at math too, to make them feel better?",
      "answer": "Actually, research suggests this backfires—especially for girls. It sends the message that math ability is inherited and fixed. Better to say: 'Math was hard for me, but I wish I'd practiced more. Let's figure this out together.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I help with homework without making it worse?",
      "answer": "Be present but not hovering. Available but not pressuring. If they ask for help, try asking 'What do you know about this problem?' before explaining. Sometimes they know more than they think—they just need someone calm nearby to remember it."
