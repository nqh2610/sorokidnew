  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is tutoring worth the cost for elementary math?",
      "answer": "For most elementary students with moderate struggles, tutoring's high cost may not be justified. At $200-300/month ($2,000-3,000 annually), you're paying for convenience and expertise. Educational apps at $10-30/month often provide similar skill-building with adaptive learning. Tutoring becomes more valuable for severe gaps, learning differences, or test prep."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can parents effectively teach math at home?",
      "answer": "Parents CAN teach at home, but it's emotionally challenging. Role conflict between 'parent' and 'teacher' often creates tension. A better approach: use educational apps for instruction while parents provide support and encouragement. This preserves the parent-child relationship while ensuring quality learning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best alternatives to expensive tutoring?",
      "answer": "Cost-effective alternatives include: educational apps with structured curricula ($10-30/month), online video lessons (Khan Academy is free), peer tutoring programs, library homework help sessions, and parent-supervised practice using quality workbooks. Many families find apps provide 80% of tutoring benefits at 10% of the cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time should kids spend on math practice at home?",
      "answer": "15-20 minutes of focused daily practice is optimal for most elementary students. Longer sessions often lead to fatigue and diminishing returns. Consistency matters more than duration—15 minutes every day beats 2 hours on weekends."
    },
    {
      "question": "At what point should I consider professional tutoring?",
      "answer": "Consider tutoring if: your child is 2+ grade levels behind, has diagnosed learning differences (ADHD, dyslexia), needs test prep for specific exams, shows no progress after 2-3 months of home learning, or you have zero time to supervise any home practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do educational apps actually work for learning math?",
      "answer": "Quality educational apps have proven effective in studies. Key features that work: adaptive difficulty, immediate feedback, gamification for engagement, and progress tracking. The key is choosing well-designed apps with actual curriculum, not just random drill games. Parent oversight increases effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I stay involved without becoming my child's math teacher?",
      "answer": "Shift from 'instructor' to 'coach': let the app teach concepts while you provide encouragement. Check the progress dashboard weekly, not during each session. Celebrate achievements without correcting mistakes. Ask 'What did you learn?' not 'Let me see if that's right.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child's school recommends tutoring?",
      "answer": "Ask specifics: What exact skills need work? How far behind are they? Try targeted home practice addressing those specific gaps first. If no improvement in 6-8 weeks, then consider tutoring. Teachers sometimes recommend tutoring as a default solution—it doesn't mean it's the only path."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I switch from tutoring to app-based learning?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is common. Use tutoring to address severe gaps or build foundation, then transition to apps for maintenance and continued growth. Set a clear tutoring 'graduation' goal with measurable criteria so the transition is planned, not indefinite."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it okay to choose apps over tutoring for financial reasons?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Choosing the affordable option isn't 'cheaping out'—it's being smart with resources. Money saved on tutoring can go toward other enrichment: books, experiences, college savings. If app-based learning meets your child's needs, there's no reason to spend more for the same outcome."
