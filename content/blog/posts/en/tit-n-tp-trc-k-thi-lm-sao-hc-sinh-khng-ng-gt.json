    "intro": "Picture this: It's the day before the unit test. You've prepared a comprehensive review covering all the key concepts. You stand at the front, explaining important formulas while students take notes. Twenty minutes in, you notice: Marcus is asleep. Sophia is staring out the window. Three students in the back are passing notes. Half the class is physically present but mentally somewhere else entirely. This was my review session reality for years. I'd re-teach everything, students would passively listen (or not), and the next day's test scores would show that almost nothing stuck. Then I discovered something that transformed my review sessions from the most dreaded day of the unit to the one students actually look forward to. Here's how I turned review from boring recap into active, game-based learning that makes concepts stick.",

    {
      "question": "How do I manage noise levels during game-based review?",
      "answer": "Establish clear noise expectations before starting. Use a visual noise meter. Build in quiet individual moments between active games. Practice stopping on signal. Some productive noise is acceptable—silent review isn't necessarily better."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if some students don't want to participate in games?",
      "answer": "Offer alternative participation roles: scorekeeper, timer, question reader. Ensure games have individual accountability so no one can hide. Address underlying issues—often resistance indicates anxiety about content knowledge rather than dislike of games."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I ensure games actually review content rather than just being fun?",
      "answer": "Require written work before verbal answers. Include problems at test difficulty level. Debrief after games: \"What concept was that question testing?\" Balance games with traditional practice. Fun should enhance learning, not replace it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best review game for students who struggle with math?",
      "answer": "Partner games where they can collaborate, like Quiz-Quiz-Trade, work well. Station rotation with a teacher support station allows targeted help. Avoid highly competitive formats that might increase anxiety for struggling learners."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much class time should review take before a test?",
      "answer": "Generally one full class period for a unit test, two for larger assessments. The review should be intensive and varied. Spreading review across multiple shorter sessions is less effective than concentrated active review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I give students the review answers in advance?",
      "answer": "No—this undermines retrieval practice. The struggle to recall is what strengthens memory. Provide answers after students have attempted retrieval, either immediately in games or on a key they can check after trying."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle a review game when I realize students don't know the content?",
      "answer": "Pause the game for mini-lessons on revealed gaps. Modify to include more scaffolding. Use partner formats so struggling students get peer support. Plan extra practice for identified weak areas. Don't power through—review is diagnostic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can game-based review work for all subjects?",
      "answer": "Yes! The principles—active retrieval, varied formats, engagement—apply across subjects. The specific games may need modification. Math lends itself well to competition and quick answers; other subjects might emphasize discussion games."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about students with test anxiety—do games help or hurt?",
      "answer": "Games generally help by practicing retrieval in low-stakes environments, building confidence and reducing anxiety. Avoid highly competitive formats for anxious students. Emphasize that review games are practice, not assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I create review games quickly without spending hours preparing?",
      "answer": "Use reusable templates (Jeopardy, Kahoot) and just swap questions. Quiz-Quiz-Trade cards are quick to make. Whiteboard problems need no prep at all. Start simple—one well-executed game beats five poorly-prepared ones."
