Until I discovered a simple tool that completely changed how I manage lessons: a timer projected on the screen.

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Which online timer is best for classrooms?",
      "answer": "A good classroom timer needs: beautiful interface, no ads, easy to project on large screens, sound alert when time's up. Sorokid Timer is designed specifically for teachers with all these features."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I prevent students from getting anxious about the countdown?",
      "answer": "Introduce the timer as a 'friend that helps manage time,' not pressure. Start with generous time limits, then gradually shorten. Praise completion on time rather than punishing lateness."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I set for group activities?",
      "answer": "Depends on task complexity: simple discussion 3-5 minutes, activities with products 7-10 minutes, small projects 15-20 minutes. Rule of thumb: set 1-2 minutes shorter than expected for buffer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use timer for ALL activities in a lesson?",
      "answer": "No. Only use timer for activities that need time limits like group discussions, exercises, quizzes. Don't use when students are sharing emotions or doing free creative activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does timer actually improve learning outcomes?",
      "answer": "Yes, but indirectly. Timer helps manage lesson time efficiently, students focus more, group activities don't drag on. Result is lesson content delivered fully, students absorb better."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if students don't finish when timer goes off?",
      "answer": "Have a rule: 'When timer rings, pencils down.' Initially some won't finish, but they'll learn to pace themselves. You can occasionally add 1-2 minutes if genuinely needed, but don't make it a habit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use phone timer instead?",
      "answer": "You can, but it's less effective. Students can't see phone screens easily. Projecting a large timer on the board makes time visible to everyone, creating shared awareness and accountability."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I introduce timer to students?",
      "answer": "Make it exciting! 'We have a new helper in class – it shows us exactly how much time we have!' Practice a few times with fun, low-stakes activities before using for real work."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about students who work slower?",
      "answer": "Timer should be for the majority. For students who need accommodations, don't apply timer strictly. Focus timer on activities where speed is appropriate, not on assessments requiring extended time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does timer work for younger students (K-2)?",
      "answer": "Yes! Young students actually respond well to visual timers. Use colorful timers with fun sounds. Start with longer times and simpler activities. They love 'beating the clock' as a game."
