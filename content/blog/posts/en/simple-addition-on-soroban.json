    "intro": "When my daughter Emma was 5, she was terrified of math. Numbers made her cry. Fast forward two years: she now does three-digit addition in her head faster than I can type it into a calculator. The secret? A simple wooden tool called the soroban. Addition on the soroban became the gateway that transformed both my kids from math-anxious to math-confident. In this comprehensive guide, I'll share exactly how I taught simple addition – the same method that thousands of Japanese children have used for generations.",

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Before we dive into technique, let me explain why soroban addition is fundamentally different from traditional math instruction. When children learn addition in school, they're memorizing abstract symbols. 2 + 3 = 5 is just a fact to remember. On the soroban, addition is visible, tangible, and logical. Your child literally sees two beads combine with three beads to make five."

        "text": "This visual-tactile approach builds genuine number sense. My son James, who struggled with traditional math homework, suddenly understood what numbers meant after just one week of soroban practice. He told me, 'Dad, I can see the numbers now.' That moment made every minute of our practice sessions worthwhile."

    {
      "question": "Why is soroban addition easier than traditional math?",

      "question": "How many beads does each column of a soroban have?",
      "answer": "Each column has 5 beads: one upper bead (heaven bead) worth 5 when pushed toward the beam, and four lower beads (earth beads) each worth 1. This allows any digit 0-9 to be represented."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which fingers should my child use for soroban addition?",
      "answer": "Use the thumb to push lower beads UP toward the beam, and the index finger to push beads DOWN (both lower beads and the heaven bead). This proper technique enables faster calculation as skills develop."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should soroban addition practice sessions be?",
      "answer": "For beginners, 10-15 minutes per session is ideal. Short, focused sessions are more effective than long, tiring ones. Always end on a successful problem to maintain positive associations with practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can soroban addition help with school math?",
      "answer": "Yes, research shows children who learn soroban demonstrate improved performance in school mathematics. The visual-spatial skills developed through soroban practice transfer to better number sense and calculation ability in all math contexts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between soroban and regular abacus addition?",
      "answer": "The Japanese soroban uses 1 upper bead (worth 5) and 4 lower beads (worth 1 each), while the Chinese abacus has 2 upper and 5 lower beads. The soroban's streamlined design enables faster, more efficient calculations."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child counts each bead individually – is that okay?",
      "answer": "This is normal for beginners. Over time, encourage them to see groups of beads as numbers (seeing '3 beads' rather than counting 'one, two, three'). Speed and pattern recognition develop naturally with practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should my child learn after mastering simple soroban addition?",
      "answer": "After single-digit addition, progress to two-digit addition (using multiple columns), the 10-complement rule (for carrying), simple subtraction, and eventually speed drills. The natural next step is addition with carrying."
