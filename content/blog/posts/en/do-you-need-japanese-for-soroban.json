    "intro": "When I first looked into soroban for my kids, I hesitated. 'It's Japanese,' I thought. 'Do they need to learn Japanese first? Will they be confused by foreign terminology? Am I setting them up for frustration?' These questions nagged at me for weeks. My husband is Japanese-American, but our kids grew up speaking only English. Would soroban be inaccessible to them? After 18 months of watching all three of my children learn soroban—entirely in English—I can give you the complete, honest answer about language requirements, plus share what actually matters for success.",

      "question": "Should I teach my child the Japanese terms for authenticity?",
