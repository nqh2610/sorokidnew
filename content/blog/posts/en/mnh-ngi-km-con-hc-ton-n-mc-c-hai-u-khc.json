    "intro": "8 PM. I'd just finished washing the dinner dishes. I sat down beside my daughter, opened her math workbook, and asked cheerfully, 'Okay, what's 7 plus 5?' She stared at the page. I waited. Asked again. Silence. I felt my patience beginning to crack. Thirty minutes later, she was crying. I was on the verge of tears myself. Another evening ending exactly like the last one. I kept telling myself I was helping my child learn math. But sitting alone at that kitchen table after she went to bed, I couldn't escape a terrible question: what exactly am I doing to my daughter?",

My voice would get louder. Her responses would get quieter. Then the tears would come."

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why do homework sessions often end in tears and frustration?",
      "answer": "The parent-child emotional dynamic creates unique pressures absent in classroom settings. Children desperately want parental approval; parental frustration—even subtle—triggers anxiety that impairs cognitive function. This creates a feedback loop: stress causes mistakes, mistakes cause frustration, frustration causes more stress. Breaking this cycle requires changing the dynamic, not just 'trying harder.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it normal for both parent and child to cry during homework?",
      "answer": "More common than many parents realize. Studies show homework is a leading cause of parent-child conflict. The intensity reflects how much both parties care about the outcome. The solution isn't caring less but supporting differently—separating emotional support from academic instruction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I stop helping with homework entirely?",
      "answer": "Not entirely, but restructure how you help. Provide a supportive environment, quality learning resources, and emotional encouragement—but minimize direct involvement during work time. Be available for genuine emergencies without hovering. Your new role is supporter and cheerleader, not primary instructor."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I rebuild my relationship after months of homework battles?",
      "answer": "Start by explicitly separating your love from academic performance. Create positive non-homework interactions. Acknowledge past struggles without dwelling on them. Give your child space and watch for signs they're ready to reconnect. Relationships heal, but healing takes time and consistency in new patterns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child's teacher expects parental homework involvement?",
      "answer": "Communicate with the teacher about your new approach. Most educators understand that stressed homework sessions are counterproductive. Explain that you're providing environment and encouragement while building your child's independence. Teachers generally support this—they see the results of over-involved parents who create dependency."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to break the homework battle cycle?",
      "answer": "Expect 2-3 weeks for new patterns to feel more natural, 4-6 weeks for significant behavior change, and 2-3 months for the new approach to become your family's norm. Setbacks are normal—stressful periods may trigger old patterns. The key is returning to new methods quickly after setbacks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What learning resources can replace direct parental instruction?",
      "answer": "Quality educational apps (like soroban programs), video tutorials designed for children, peer study groups, and occasional professional tutoring. These provide patient, consistent instruction without the parent-child emotional charge. The best resources adapt to your child's level and provide immediate, non-judgmental feedback."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child says they 'can't' do homework without me. How do I respond?",
      "answer": "Acknowledge their feeling ('I understand it feels hard') while expressing confidence ('I believe you can try'). Start very small—one problem independently. Celebrate any attempt regardless of accuracy. Over time, expand expectations. The 'can't' usually reflects anxiety more than ability; reducing pressure allows capability to emerge."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I manage my own stress during this transition?",
      "answer": "Recognize that discomfort during change is normal—you're breaking habits. Focus on long-term goals over short-term perfection. Find other parents who've made similar changes for support. Remind yourself that your current approach was causing harm; discomfort from change is better than continued damage from the status quo."
