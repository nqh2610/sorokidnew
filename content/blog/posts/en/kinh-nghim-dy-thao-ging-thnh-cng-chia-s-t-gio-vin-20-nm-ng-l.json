    "intro": "Twenty years of teaching. Countless observed lessons. From trembling through my first demonstration while a panel of administrators scribbled notes, to now feeling calm confidence when visitors fill the back row. The difference isn't some natural gift—it's experience earned through both failures and successes. I've bombed lessons that I thought were perfect. I've saved lessons that were falling apart. I've learned that the secret to successful demo lessons isn't being a 'natural'—it's preparation, self-awareness, and learning from every experience. This guide shares everything I wish someone had told me before my first observation.",

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How far in advance should I prepare for an observed lesson?",
      "answer": "Start at least a week before for formal evaluations. Create your plan early, then refine it. Practice the lesson 2-3 times in the days leading up. Prepare all materials the day before. This timeline prevents last-minute panic and allows for thoughtful adjustments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I tell students we're being observed?",
      "answer": "Yes, briefly. Students appreciate knowing and often rise to the occasion. Keep it low-key: 'We'll have visitors today. Just be yourselves and do your best work.' Don't make it a bigger deal than it needs to be—that creates more anxiety for everyone."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if students behave differently because observers are present?",
      "answer": "They often do—sometimes better, sometimes worse. Don't force artificial normalcy. Handle whatever happens with your regular approaches. Observers understand that the presence of visitors changes dynamics; they're watching how YOU respond, not expecting perfection from students."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle a lesson that's clearly going poorly?",
      "answer": "Don't panic. Acknowledge to yourself that it's not going as planned, then adapt. It's okay to say to students: 'Let me try explaining this a different way.' Skip sections if needed. End with something that works. The ability to adjust shows teaching skill."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use technology in a demo lesson?",
      "answer": "Only if you're confident with it AND have a backup plan. Technology that fails or distracts from learning is worse than no technology. If you use tech, test it beforehand in the actual classroom. Never rely on something you haven't tried successfully before."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I disagree with the feedback I receive?",
      "answer": "Listen first—sometimes feedback that feels wrong initially makes sense after reflection. If you still disagree, you can respectfully share your perspective: 'I hear your point. My thinking was...' But choose your battles. Not every disagreement needs to be voiced."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I make students more engaged during observations?",
      "answer": "Plan engaging activities! Use pair work, hands-on materials, movement, student choice, collaborative tasks, and varied questioning. Students naturally engage when the lesson structure invites participation. Engagement is designed into the lesson, not added at the last minute."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm nervous and my anxiety shows?",
      "answer": "Most observers understand that being observed is stressful. Some nervousness is normal and won't count against you. If you feel anxiety rising, take a breath, focus on one student, and remember you know what you're doing. Teaching is what you do every day."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important is the lesson plan document itself?",
      "answer": "It varies by context. For formal evaluations, a detailed written plan is often required and scrutinized. For informal observations, your actual teaching matters more than the document. When in doubt, have a clear, detailed plan available—it shows professionalism and helps you if you get flustered."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does a 'perfect' lesson mean a great evaluation?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Observers look for effective teaching, not perfection. A lesson where you skillfully adapt when something goes wrong might impress more than one that goes flawlessly but shows no decision-making. Focus on good teaching, not on performing a flawless show."
