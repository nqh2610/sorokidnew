    "intro": "As a family therapist, I've counseled hundreds of parents struggling with homework battles. But when it came to my own daughter Emma's math struggles, I made every mistake in the book. For two years, I thought I was helping—but I was actually making things worse. The tension, the tears, the dreaded 'I hate math' declaration... all of it was partly my fault. Here are the 5 mistakes I made and how I finally learned to fix them.",

      {
        "question": "What if I've been making these mistakes for years? Is it too late?",

You can even acknowledge past mistakes directly: 'I'm going to try something different because I think my old way wasn't helping.' Kids respect honesty."
      },
      {
        "question": "My child really does seem slower than other kids. Shouldn't I address that?",
        "answer": "'Slower' often just means 'different learning style' or 'needs more foundational work.' Focus on finding what works for YOUR child rather than comparing timelines. Some kids who seem 'slow' at first develop the deepest understanding later because they're building stronger foundations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I hide my frustration when I genuinely feel it?",
        "answer": "Don't hide it—take a break. It's okay to say 'Let's pause and come back to this in 10 minutes.' Your emotional state directly affects your child's ability to learn. Managing your frustration isn't about acting; it's about stepping away before it affects the session."

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What are the most common mistakes parents make when helping with math?",
      "answer": "The five most common mistakes are: comparing children to others, showing visible frustration, talking too much instead of listening, making practice sessions too long, and focusing on answers instead of thinking process. All of these can be fixed with awareness and intentional changes to your approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I help my child with math without getting frustrated?",
      "answer": "Keep sessions short (15-20 minutes maximum), take breaks when you feel frustration rising, ask questions instead of lecturing, and remember that repeated mistakes indicate a need for different explanation, not child deficiency. Your calm is more important than your expertise."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I compare my child to classmates who are better at math?",
      "answer": "Never compare children to others—it creates anxiety and damages confidence. Instead, compare your child to their past self: 'Last week this took 10 minutes, now it takes 7.' This builds a growth mindset where progress is personal, not competitive."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should math homework help sessions last?",
      "answer": "Research shows 10-20 minutes is optimal for elementary-age children. Beyond that, cognitive fatigue sets in and retention drops. Short daily sessions are far more effective than occasional long marathons. If you hit a wall, stop and try again tomorrow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my child guess answers instead of thinking through problems?",
      "answer": "Answer-focused environments create guessing behavior. When we only praise correct answers, children learn to guess hoping to be right rather than thinking carefully. Shift to praising process: 'I love how you broke that into smaller steps' or 'Good job checking your work.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if I'm showing frustration even when I think I'm calm?",
      "answer": "Children read micro-expressions with devastating accuracy. Signs you may be showing frustration: sighing, impatient tone, rushed explanations, closed body language, or 'the look.' If you're not sure, ask your child directly—their answer may surprise you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it too late to fix my approach if I've been doing it wrong for years?",
      "answer": "It's never too late. Children are remarkably resilient and respond quickly to positive changes. You can even acknowledge past mistakes directly. Most children adjust within weeks when they sense a genuinely different, supportive approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do I talk so much when helping with math? How do I listen better?",
      "answer": "Parents naturally want to explain and fix. Break this habit by asking questions first: 'Walk me through your thinking,' 'Where does it get confusing?' 'What have you tried?' Often, children spot their own errors just by explaining. And you'll understand their actual confusion."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can visual tools like soroban help struggling math students?",
      "answer": "Visual-tactile tools like the soroban externalize mental processes, making abstract math concrete and visible. Children can see what's happening instead of holding everything in working memory. This reduces cognitive load and helps build genuine understanding rather than rote memorization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I do when my child says they hate math?",
      "answer": "'I hate math' usually means 'math makes me feel bad about myself.' Check your own approach for comparison, visible frustration, or answer-focused feedback. Create positive experiences with short sessions, process praise, and tools that make math tangible. The goal is to rebuild their relationship with math."
