        "question": "How do I balance teams fairly?",

        "question": "What if a student refuses to participate in competition?",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is classroom gamification?",
      "answer": "Classroom gamification applies game elements—points, leaderboards, competitions, rewards—to educational activities. It leverages natural competitive instincts and reward-seeking behavior to increase student engagement, motivation, and participation without changing the actual learning content."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do classroom leaderboards increase student engagement?",
      "answer": "Leaderboards tap into psychological drivers: loss aversion (not wanting to fall behind), social proof (seeing peers engaged), immediate feedback (visible progress), and variable rewards (uncertainty creates excitement). The visual display makes abstract progress concrete and public."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best tools for classroom competitions?",
      "answer": "Popular options include Kahoot and Quizizz for quiz-based games, Classcraft for ongoing RPG-style competition, ClassDojo for behavior tracking, Gimkit for self-paced racing, and Sorokid's classroom tools for various competition formats. Google Slides can work for simple manual tracking."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I form fair teams for classroom competitions?",
      "answer": "Mix skill levels so each team has strong and developing students. Avoid friend-group teams which create uneven competition. Use 3-5 students per team for optimal participation. Rotate team composition periodically to prevent fixed rivalries and ensure varied collaboration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if some students get discouraged by competition?",
      "answer": "Add comeback mechanics like bonus questions or power-ups for trailing teams. Run shorter races so no one stays behind long. Recognize multiple achievements beyond first place. Offer alternative roles for students who genuinely struggle with competition. Balance with collaborative activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I use competitive games in class?",
      "answer": "Once or twice per week maintains novelty without overuse. Save races for review sessions, not new content introduction. Too frequent competition dilutes excitement and can increase anxiety. Variety in teaching methods serves all learning styles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do classroom competitions work for all subjects?",
      "answer": "Yes, with adaptation. Any subject with questions to answer can use competition. Math, vocabulary, science facts, history dates, literature comprehension—all work well. Adjust question types and difficulty to match your content. Even creative subjects can compete on criteria."
    },
    {
      "question": "What prizes should winning teams receive?",
      "answer": "Small rewards work best: first pick of seats, line leader for the day, homework pass, stickers, or simply bragging rights. The competition itself is the primary motivation—excessive prizes can shift focus from learning to reward-seeking."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I prevent one student from dominating team answers?",
      "answer": "Require rotation where each member must answer before anyone goes twice. Use relay formats with mandatory sequence. Award bonus points when different team members contribute. Create roles like 'captain' that rotate each round."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is competition harmful for students' mental health?",
      "answer": "Healthy competition teaches resilience and motivation. However, watch for stress signals, never mock losing teams, emphasize effort over outcomes, and provide non-competitive alternatives. Balance competitive activities with collaborative ones. Some students genuinely thrive on competition while others need gentler approaches."
