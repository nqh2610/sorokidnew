    "intro": "After my son learned Sorokid for a month, I joined a parent group on Facebook. I saw everyone showing off beautiful Soroban abacuses – wooden, plastic, all kinds of colors. I got excited and ordered one. $15 on Amazon. When it arrived, my son loved it – for exactly 2 weeks. Then he went back to the app. The physical Soroban now sits in a corner collecting dust. I'm writing this to share: should you buy one, and when is it actually useful?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is a physical Soroban required to learn?",
      "answer": "No. If learning through an app like Sorokid, the app already has a full virtual abacus. A physical Soroban is supplementary, not mandatory."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is better – real abacus or app?",
      "answer": "Each has advantages. Physical Soroban helps 'feel' numbers tangibly. App has tutorials, auto-grading, and rewards. Combining both is best."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to buy a physical Soroban?",
      "answer": "After your child has learned basics on the app (1-2 months). By then, they know how to move beads and can use the physical one for practice and testing."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child only wants to use the physical Soroban. Is that okay?",
      "answer": "It's fine, but you'll need to sit with them to check answers since there's no auto-grading. Most parents find this isn't sustainable long-term, and kids usually prefer the app's instant feedback."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child gets bored of the physical Soroban quickly?",
      "answer": "Very common. Kids miss the instant feedback and rewards that apps provide. Use the physical Soroban for periodic spot-checks or screen-break practice, not as the main learning tool."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I buy wooden or plastic?",
      "answer": "For young kids, plastic is more practical – durable and doesn't break if dropped. Wood looks nicer but offers no learning advantage. Focus on smooth-sliding beads, not material."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use a Chinese abacus instead?",
      "answer": "Chinese suanpan has a different bead configuration (2+5 vs Soroban's 1+4). It works but most apps use Japanese Soroban style. Better to match what your app uses for consistency."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I use a physical Soroban if I don't know how it works?",
      "answer": "Watch your child use the app first to understand the movements. Or have your child teach you – if they can explain, they truly understand. You don't need to be an expert."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my child progress faster with a physical Soroban?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Progress depends on consistency and correct practice, not the tool. Apps often lead to faster progress because of built-in guidance and motivation. Physical Sorobans are supplementary."
