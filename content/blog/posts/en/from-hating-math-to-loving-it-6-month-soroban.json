    "intro": "I'm writing this at 8:47 PM on a Tuesday night. My 8-year-old daughter Emma just asked if she could stay up 10 more minutes to 'finish this level' on her Soroban app. Six months ago at this exact time, I was physically holding her hand while she sobbed through addition problems. I never imagined we'd get here. If your child hates math—truly hates it, with tears and anxiety and 'I can't do it' before even looking at the problem—I want you to know that transformation is possible. Here's exactly how it happened for us.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How quickly did you see improvement?",
      "answer": "The emotional shift (enjoying Soroban practice) happened within weeks. Transfer to school math took 2-3 months. Full confidence transformation took the entire 6 months. It's a gradual process, not overnight magic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Emma's math grades improve?",
      "answer": "Yes, from C/C- to B+, with continuing improvement. But honestly, the grade improvement was less significant to me than the confidence transformation. A kid who believes they CAN do math will continue improving. Grades are just a lagging indicator."
    },
    {
      "question": "What did you do on days Emma didn't want to practice?",
      "answer": "I shortened it. 'Just 5 minutes, just 5 problems.' Consistency mattered more than volume. I never forced long sessions, but I almost never let her skip entirely. The habit was too important."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Soroban replace homework help or school math?",
      "answer": "No, Soroban was additional—a separate 15-minute activity. But as her confidence grew, homework became easier and took less time. So the total math time didn't increase much."
    },
    {
      "question": "Would this work for every child with math anxiety?",
      "answer": "I can't promise that. But I believe if the anxiety stems from not understanding numbers or repeated failure experiences, Soroban's visual approach and confidence-building progression can help many kids. It's worth trying—especially with free trials available."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did you prevent Soroban from becoming another source of stress?",
      "answer": "I never called it 'math,' never connected it to school, never pushed past her comfort zone, and always stopped while she was still enjoying it. The psychological separation from her math trauma was crucial."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child is older than 7?",
      "answer": "I've heard success stories from parents of kids up to 11-12 who started Soroban. Younger may build faster habits, but older kids can still transform their relationship with math. It's never too late."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Emma ever resist Soroban or want to quit?",
      "answer": "Occasionally in the early months, yes. On those days, we did minimal practice (5 minutes) and I didn't push. By month 3, resistance became rare. By month 5, she was requesting extra practice. The key was patience in the early stages."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did you introduce Soroban without triggering math anxiety?",
      "answer": "I called it a 'Japanese bead game.' I didn't mention math at all initially. I let the app introduce the connection gradually after she was already enjoying it. By then, she'd built positive associations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your advice for the first week?",
      "answer": "Keep it short (10 minutes max), celebrate every success loudly, don't correct mistakes yourself (let the app do it), and most importantly—stop while your child is still smiling. Leave them wanting more. Build positive anticipation."
