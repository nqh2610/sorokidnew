We were on a tight budget – there was no way I could afford $200-300 a month for extra tutoring. I thought: 'Without money, my child is already behind from the starting line.'",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "I'm not good at math myself. How can I teach my child?",
      "answer": "You don't need to know how to solve math problems. You just need to find tools or resources for your child to learn from. YouTube, learning apps, parent groups – all are free support sources. Your role is to accompany and encourage, not teach directly."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is a tutor actually necessary?",
      "answer": "A tutor is really needed when your child has serious difficulties (falling significantly behind the class), or has special issues requiring professional intervention. If your child is just average and needs improvement, self-learning with parent support and the right tools is usually enough."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child won't learn on their own?",
      "answer": "Start very small, just 5-10 minutes. Choose apps with games so they find it fun. Praise them when they complete something. Gradually they'll get used to it and become more self-motivated. The key is don't push too hard and make them scared."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I stay motivated to help my child consistently?",
      "answer": "Remember why you started. Track small wins – celebrate when your child learns something new. Connect with other parents in similar situations for support. And give yourself grace on hard days – skipping one day won't undo all your progress."
    },
    {
      "question": "What free resources do you recommend?",
      "answer": "YouTube for explaining concepts, Khan Academy for structured lessons, math apps like Sorokid for practice, and Facebook/online parent groups for Q&A. Most worksheets and practice tests can be found free online with a simple Google search."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child's school is more advanced than what I can teach?",
      "answer": "This is where YouTube and online tutorials shine. Teachers and education channels explain everything from basic to advanced topics. You don't need to know everything – you just need to help your child find the right explanation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle subjects I really don't understand?",
      "answer": "Post in parent groups – there's always someone who knows. Watch multiple YouTube videos until you find one that makes sense. Sometimes having your child explain it to you after watching a video helps them solidify their own understanding."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is 10 minutes a day really enough?",
      "answer": "Yes! 10 minutes of focused, daily practice is more effective than 2 hours once a week. The brain needs repetition and rest to form long-term memories. Short, consistent sessions beat long, occasional ones every time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child complains the app is boring?",
      "answer": "Try different apps until you find one they like. Rotate between apps to keep things fresh. Add small rewards for completing sessions. Make it a game – challenge them to beat their own score or complete before a timer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I tell my child's teacher I'm teaching at home?",
      "answer": "It can be helpful! Teachers appreciate knowing you're supporting at home. They can tell you what areas to focus on and may share resources. It also helps them understand your child's progress context."
