    "intro": "'Mom, how much is this?' My eight-year-old held up a pack of Oreos at Target. '$4.49,' I said. 'If I give you $5, what's my change?' She thought for a second: '51 cents.' 'Nice. But that pack has 36 cookies. If we're five people and we share equally, how many cookies does each person get?' She scrunched her face, counted on her fingers: 'Seven... with one left over!' 'For whoever did the math,' I smiled. She beamed. My daughter had just done division with remainders. She doesn't know she's learning. To her, we're just chatting at Target. This is my secret: I've turned our entire life into stealth math practice. Grocery shopping, cooking, car rides, even bedtime—opportunities are everywhere once you start seeing them. And the best part? No worksheets. No resistance. No 'I hate math.' Just life, with numbers woven in.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is everyday math and why does it matter?",
      "answer": "Everyday math means weaving mathematical thinking into daily activities like shopping, cooking, and car rides. It builds 'number sense'—an intuitive feel for how numbers work—which worksheets alone can't develop. Children with strong number sense have an easier time with formal math."
    },
    {
      "question": "At what age can I start doing everyday math with my child?",
      "answer": "You can start as early as age 3-4 with simple counting and 'more vs. less' comparisons. By age 5-6, children can handle simple addition and subtraction in context. The key is matching complexity to their current level and keeping it casual."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does everyday math replace formal math practice?",
      "answer": "No—it supplements formal learning, not replaces it. Everyday math builds number sense and positive associations, but children still need structured practice for fact fluency and procedure mastery. The ideal combination is both."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child doesn't want to answer my math questions?",
      "answer": "Never force participation. Instead, think aloud: 'I wonder how much change we'll get...' and answer yourself. Model mathematical thinking without demanding engagement. Sometimes they'll chime in unprompted; when they don't, let it go."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I keep everyday math from feeling like a test?",
      "answer": "The key is staying casual. Never announce 'let's do math.' Ask questions conversationally, accept any answer without judgment, keep it brief (one or two questions), and let some wrong answers slide. The moment kids feel tested, the magic disappears."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best everyday activities for math practice?",
      "answer": "Grocery shopping (prices, quantities, budgets), cooking (fractions, measurement, time), car rides (distance, time, counting games), and household tasks (sorting coins, measuring rooms, calendar planning) all offer rich math opportunities."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is resistant to any math—will everyday math help?",
      "answer": "Yes—everyday math can rebuild positive associations with numbers because it doesn't feel like 'math.' Start with thinking aloud rather than direct questions, and let them engage voluntarily. Over time, they often begin participating naturally."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I do everyday math activities?",
      "answer": "There's no schedule—just look for natural opportunities. One or two math moments per outing or activity is plenty. The goal is multiple short exposures over time, not intensive sessions. Frequency matters more than duration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not good at math myself?",
      "answer": "You don't need to be a math expert. Basic arithmetic from daily life is enough—prices, measurements, time calculations. If you make mistakes, that's fine; working through them together models good problem-solving. Your attitude matters more than your ability."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I tell if everyday math is helping my child?",
      "answer": "Signs of progress: your child starts noticing numbers in the environment, makes estimates naturally, catches 'wrong' answers that don't make sense, and applies math in new situations unprompted. These indicate strong number sense developing."
