I'd explain something, she'd push back. I'd correct her, she'd cry. I'd get frustrated, she'd shut down. I blamed her for being difficult. It took months to realize: the problem wasn't her behavior—it was my approach.",

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why does my child listen to their teacher but not to me?",
      "answer": "Children 'perform' at school due to social expectations and formal environment. At home, with unconditionally loving parents, they feel safe to show authentic emotions including frustration, tiredness, and resistance. This is actually psychologically healthy—they trust you with their real feelings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I stop homework battles with my child?",
      "answer": "Key strategies: reconnect emotionally before homework (snacks, casual talk), ask questions instead of giving answers, match the teacher's methods, use shorter sessions with breaks, let apps handle instruction while you provide support, and regulate your own frustration first."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my child cry during homework?",
      "answer": "Common causes: end-of-day mental exhaustion, feeling criticized when corrected, confusion from different home vs school methods, sensing parent frustration, or genuine learning struggles. Address the underlying cause rather than just demanding they stop crying."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it normal for kids to argue with parents during homework?",
      "answer": "Yes, extremely common. Parent-child homework tension stems from role confusion (mom/dad becoming teacher), children releasing school-day stress at home, and parents often having higher expectations than teachers. Understanding this normalizes the struggle while motivating approach changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I stop helping with homework if it causes fights?",
      "answer": "Consider alternatives: educational apps that teach concepts, letting the other parent help, hiring a tutor, or limiting your role to supervision rather than instruction. Preserving your relationship is more important than any single assignment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I stay calm when my child frustrates me during homework?",
      "answer": "Strategies: take breaks before you reach frustration, set a timer to prevent marathon sessions, remind yourself their resistance isn't personal, lower your expectations for end-of-day performance, and practice phrases like 'let's take a break' rather than showing exasperation."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child says I teach differently than their teacher. What should I do?",
      "answer": "Ask the teacher how concepts are taught at school and match that method exactly. When home and school approaches conflict, children get confused and defensive. Consistency between settings helps them learn without the stress of competing systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should homework sessions be for elementary students?",
      "answer": "Research suggests 10 minutes per grade level is appropriate (e.g., 20 minutes for 2nd grade). Shorter focused sessions with breaks work better than one long marathon. Attention spans are limited, especially after a full school day."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I seek outside help for homework struggles?",
      "answer": "Consider tutoring or professional help if: battles persist despite approach changes, you suspect learning differences (ADHD, dyslexia), homework causes panic attacks or physical symptoms, or the parent-child relationship is suffering significant damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I help my child see me as supportive, not critical?",
      "answer": "Shift from telling to asking ('How did you get that?' instead of 'That's wrong'). Praise effort and process, not just results. Acknowledge their feelings ('Math can be frustrating'). Celebrate small wins. Let them struggle briefly before helping—rescue too quickly feels controlling."
