  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can my child do mental math after 3 months of Soroban?",
      "answer": "For most children, 3 months is enough to get comfortable with the abacus and do simple calculations while looking at it. True mental math (Anzan) typically starts around 5-6 months or later."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should my child practice each day?",
      "answer": "15-20 minutes daily is appropriate for elementary school children. Short but consistent practice is better than long but irregular sessions."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is slower than others. Is something wrong?",
      "answer": "No. Every child learns differently. What matters is that your child is improving compared to themselves yesterday, not compared to other children."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do we need to take level exams?",
      "answer": "Not required. Levels are just a way to measure progress. If your child is learning Soroban to improve mental math, you don't need to worry about formal certifications."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child has been practicing for 4 months with no mental math. Is this normal?",
      "answer": "Completely normal. Mental math typically emerges around months 5-6 for most kids. Some take longer. Keep practicing consistently and be patient."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can older kids catch up to those who started younger?",
      "answer": "For practical everyday math, yes. Kids who start at 8 might take slightly longer to reach the same level, but they'll get there. Starting age matters more for competition-level performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my child is progressing normally?",
      "answer": "If they're improving at all – even slowly – they're progressing. Good apps like Sorokid track this automatically and adjust difficulty based on your child's performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child doesn't want to practice some days?",
      "answer": "Don't force it. Learning should be enjoyable, not stressful. Skip that day and try again tomorrow. Forcing practice can make children hate Soroban."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will I see my child using mental math in daily life?",
      "answer": "Usually around months 6-8. You might notice them doing simple calculations without counting fingers, or quickly answering mental math questions while shopping or playing games."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Soroban worth the long-term commitment?",
      "answer": "Based on my experience, absolutely. The skills my son developed – not just calculation speed, but focus and confidence – have been invaluable. It takes patience, but the payoff is real."
