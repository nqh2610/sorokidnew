    "intro": "When my daughter Mia started 1st grade, I watched other parents sign their children up for after-school math programs, private tutors, and enrichment classes. The prices were staggering—$50 to $100 per hour for a tutor, $200 to $400 monthly for learning centers. On our single income, we couldn't afford any of it. I felt like I was failing my child before she even had a chance. I worried constantly: Would Mia fall behind? Was I limiting her future because of our financial situation? Three years later, Mia is thriving. She's at the top of her math class, genuinely enjoys numbers, and has never had a single tutoring session. This article shares everything we did to provide excellent math education on a tight budget—proving that great math learning doesn't require great wealth.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can children really learn math well without tutoring?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Most children worldwide learn math without private tutoring. Research shows that consistent parental engagement, quality resources, and daily practice can equal or exceed tutoring outcomes. The key is consistency and positive attitude, not professional instruction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best free math resource for elementary children?",
      "answer": "Khan Academy offers comprehensive, completely free math curriculum for all grade levels with video explanations and practice problems. Combined with library resources and daily math conversations, it provides excellent foundation without any cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time should I spend on math daily with my child?",
      "answer": "Research suggests 15-20 minutes of focused daily practice is more effective than longer occasional sessions. This can include app time, homework help, or casual math conversations. Consistency matters more than duration."
    },
    {
      "question": "I'm not good at math—can I still help my child?",
      "answer": "Yes! Elementary math doesn't require advanced skills, and resources like videos and apps do the actual teaching. Your role is to encourage, supervise, and create positive associations with math. Learning alongside your child actually models growth mindset."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are educational apps as effective as tutoring?",
      "answer": "Quality apps used consistently can be very effective, especially for practice and reinforcement. They offer daily engagement versus weekly tutoring, immediate feedback, adaptive difficulty, and much lower cost. Apps work best when combined with parental involvement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child falls behind despite my efforts?",
      "answer": "First, communicate with their teacher to identify specific gaps. Schools offer free intervention services for struggling students. If needed, explore low-cost options like university student tutors, community programs, or sliding-scale services before expensive private tutoring."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my budget approach is working?",
      "answer": "Track school grades and test scores, observe attitude toward math, watch for increasing independence with homework, and communicate with teachers about progress. Most importantly, notice if your child engages with math willingly rather than with dread."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I feel guilty that I can't afford tutoring?",
      "answer": "No. Tutoring is not a requirement for math success—it's one option among many. Research shows parental engagement and consistent practice matter more than professional instruction. Focus on what you can provide: time, encouragement, and curiosity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Sorokid compare to expensive math programs?",
      "answer": "Sorokid provides a comprehensive Soroban-based curriculum at a fraction of tutoring costs. The visual, tactile approach builds strong number sense. Daily use of affordable apps can provide more math exposure than weekly tutoring sessions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the biggest mistake budget-conscious parents make?",
      "answer": "Inconsistency. Many parents try free resources sporadically, see slow results, and give up. The power of budget approaches is in daily consistency. Fifteen minutes every day for a year is far more effective than expensive but inconsistent tutoring."
