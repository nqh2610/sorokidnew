Gets a 60% when she should have gotten 90-100%. I know she's correct, but the teacher grades what she submits. This has to be fixable, right?",

      "question": "Does using a timer create pressure?",
      "answer": "It can, if used wrong. Principle: start with comfortable time limits, reduce gradually. If your child gets stressed → stop the timer. Goal is cheerful improvement, not competition."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is in 4th-5th grade and still slow. Is it too late?",
      "answer": "Not too late, but needs focus. At 4th-5th grade, problems are more complex. If basic facts aren't fast, they'll struggle. Prioritize Math Facts immediately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Flashcards or app – which is better?",
      "answer": "Combine both. Flashcards are good for quick drilling, apps (like Sorokid) have gamification that keeps kids interested. Variety = kids don't get bored."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Soroban help with speed?",
      "answer": "Soroban trains the brain to visualize numbers as images (abacus). When mastered, they 'see' the picture in their head and know the answer instantly – called Anzan. Much faster than counting."
    },
    {
      "question": "My child is scared of timed tests. What do I do?",
      "answer": "Practice at home with gradual pressure. Start with no timer. Then timer with generous time limits. Slowly increase pressure so they adapt. As confidence grows, fear decreases."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I have my child compete with classmates?",
      "answer": "Depends on personality. If they enjoy competition → can be helpful. If sensitive and tends to compare negatively → don't. Best is competing with THEMSELVES: faster today than yesterday."
    },
    {
      "question": "Besides Sorokid, what other ways build speed?",

    },
    {
      "question": "My child writes numbers slowly. Is that related?",
      "answer": "Yes. Slow/messy number writing also takes time. Practice writing numbers alongside calculation practice. Sorokid can help since they just tap, no writing needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is 10 minutes/day enough?",
      "answer": "Enough if consistent. 10 min × 30 days = 300 min = 5 hours. More effective than cramming 5 hours on the weekend because the brain needs time to consolidate between sessions."
