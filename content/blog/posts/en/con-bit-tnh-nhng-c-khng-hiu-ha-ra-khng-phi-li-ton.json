I asked him: 'What's 24 minus 8?' He answered immediately: '16.' So why couldn't he solve the word problem? That question led me down a path that completely changed how I understood my son's struggles.",

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why can my child calculate but not solve word problems?",
      "answer": "Word problems require reading comprehension, vocabulary, and the ability to translate stories into math operations—separate skills from calculation. Your child may excel at arithmetic but struggle with the language-processing step that comes before calculation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are keyword strategies effective for word problems?",
      "answer": "Keywords (like 'altogether means add') have limited effectiveness. They teach pattern matching rather than comprehension and fail on non-standard problems. Visualization and true comprehension strategies are more reliable long-term."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I help my child understand word problems better?",
      "answer": "Use the visualization approach: have them draw the situation, retell the problem in their own words, identify whether quantities are increasing or decreasing, then do the math. This builds genuine comprehension rather than keyword reliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are numberless word problems?",
      "answer": "Problems without specific numbers that focus on comprehension: 'Lan has some candies and gives some away. Does she have more or fewer now?' This isolates the translation skill from calculation, helping children understand what operations mean."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does improving general reading help with math word problems?",
      "answer": "Yes, significantly. Reading comprehension skills—summarizing, inferring, visualizing while reading—directly transfer to word problem ability. Children who read more and discuss what they read often improve at word problems too."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I be concerned about word problem struggles?",
      "answer": "If strategies aren't helping after 2-3 months of consistent practice, or if your child struggles with reading comprehension generally, consider evaluation for dyslexia, language processing issues, or attention challenges that may underlie the difficulty."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I read word problems aloud to my child?",
      "answer": "Yes, especially initially. Reading aloud removes the decoding burden, letting your child focus on comprehension. Gradually transition to them reading independently as skills improve. Hearing problems can help with language rhythm and meaning."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if it's a comprehension or math issue?",
      "answer": "Test separately: Can your child solve the same math as a calculation? (24-8=?) If yes but word problems fail, it's likely comprehension. Can they explain what's happening in the problem without solving? If not, comprehension is the barrier."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best way to practice word problems at home?",
      "answer": "Use real-life situations (shopping, cooking, sharing snacks), create your own problems from calculations, do numberless problems for comprehension, and read/discuss math story problems without pressure to solve immediately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can apps help with word problem comprehension?",
      "answer": "Apps can build calculation fluency (freeing mental energy for comprehension) and provide varied problem formats. However, the comprehension-building work—visualization, discussion, real-life application—usually requires parent interaction rather than apps alone."
