    "intro": "The first time I heard 'Soroban,' I thought it was a sushi roll. Seriously. Then I saw a video of a 7-year-old mentally calculating five 3-digit numbers in seconds – no calculator, no paper, just closing her eyes and giving the answer. Correct. I couldn't believe it. Meanwhile, my 8-year-old still counts on his fingers for 47 + 38.",

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Sounds complicated? I thought so too at first. But the principle is actually simple: instead of counting 1, 2, 3... kids learn to 'see' numbers by the position of beads. It's like reading a clock – you glance at it and instantly know the time without counting each minute marker."

Even in the digital age, Japanese parents have their kids learn Soroban because they believe it trains the brain, not just calculation skills."

        "question": "How long until my child can do mental math with Soroban?",
